	abstract = {Although the war in Afghanistan is now in its endgame, the West’s struggle to eliminate the threat from Al Qaeda is far from over. A decade after 9/11, the war on terror has entered a new phase and, it would seem, a new territory. In early 2010, Al Qaeda operatives were reportedly “streaming” out of central Asia toward Somalia and the surrounding region.Somalia, now home to some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists, was already the world’s most failed state. Two decades of anarchy have spawned not just Islamic extremism but piracy, famine, and a seemingly endless clan-based civil war that has killed an estimated 500,000, turned millions into refugees, and caused hundreds of thousands more to flee and settle in Europe and North America.What is now happening in Somalia directly threatens the security of the world, possibly more than any other region on earth. James Fergusson’s book is the first accessible account of how Somalia became the world’s most dangerous place and what we can—and should—do about it.},

"And {AMISOM} gave them a winner." Al-Shabab gained popular support at first simply because it seemed able to bring stability. Most Somalis tend to be pragmatic above all, says Egal: "A lot of people I know who don't even pray are pretending to be part of that religious lifestyle so they can be accepted." Now those businessmen are finding their names on U.N. sanctions lists and their assets frozen. The trend is shifting. Somalis have seen how ruthless Al-Shabab's version of Islam can be. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been driven to the edge of starvation by the group's blockades against Western food aid. And they're tired of war. "They have been in a conflict for 20 years, and they have seen a lot of suffering," says General Mugisha. "They also want some peace."}
