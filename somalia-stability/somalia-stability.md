Stability and Somalia are words not often in close proximity.  Somalia
ranked first on the list of the most failed states from 2008–2013 and
currently ranks second.  [@failed-states-14] Considering the former
political volatility, any semblance of stability Somalia is emergent
rather than established.  The political environment, the military and
the physical environment are the emergent drivers of stability in
Somalia.  The political environment stabilizes Somalia by providing a
coherent, and internationally recognized government.  The military
stabilizes Somalia by providing consistent security under the African
Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and slowly defeating the terrorist
group Al-Shabaab.  The physical environment stabilizes Somalia by
attracting foreign investment for access to abundant natural resources
Somalia's strategic location in the horn of Africa.


<!-- Politics -->

Political stability was achieved after two decades of constant
conflict and regime changes.  Though the newly established Federal
Republic of Somalia leads the world in corruption, signs indicate that
political stability will endure.[@transparency-13-corruption] With the
ratification of the constitution in 2012, key international
organizations, including the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank recognized Somalia's nascent government.  Several countries
formally reopened diplomatic channels with Somalia, to include the
United States. [@adan-13-new-african]

The recent presidential election highlights the advances of the
political processes.  A university professor, Hassan Sheik Mohamud,
ousted the incumbent, Sheikh Sharif, despite the fact that Sharif
spent $7 million in bribes to rig the election.
[@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 114] Shortly after securing the
presidency, Mohamud was named to the *Time 100* for his contributions
against corruption and his role in stabilizing the war torn
Somalia. [@kagame-13-time] Presidents Mohamud's success was greatly
eased by al-Shabaab publicity missteps.  James Fergusson, an
experienced reporter with time in Somalia and Afghanistan, contrasted
the techniques of the Taliban and al-Shabaab:

> "The Taliban put great importance on getting their message across to
> an international audience, and were prepared to take considerable
> risks to do so. They understood that the continuation of NATO’s war
> depended on Western public approval ratings, and that the foreign
> media offered them their best opportunity to undermine
> these. Al-Shabaab, by contrast, usually just wanted to shoot the
> messenger. Their common assumption, almost a default position, was
> that all journalists—even local ones—were traitors and spies.
> [...] This meant that there was no phone number a journalist could
> call to request an interview, no email address to write to, and of
> course no physical office to visit."

Despite recent gains, there are serious hindrances to a unified
Somalia.  Somalia, the nation-state, is a loose concept that varies in
the regions throughout the country.  Somaliland and Puntland are
semi-autonomous regions that govern their own affairs. Additionally,
the political process has not yet reached the level of decorum
expected in a modern state. Fistfights frequently occur in the
parliament, occasionally escalating to full brawls. In the last brawl,
four representatives were admitted to the hospital with head
injuries. [@heaton-12-somalia] The US House of Representatives
demonstrated similar behavior in 1858, igniting a melee in which over
30 representatives engaged in close quarters battle.[@ushouse-14-brawl]
Accordingly, the Somali political process should be viewed as early in
its lifetime.

Al-Shabaab's inability to overcome rigid ideology and spread their
message undermines their support amongst the populace.  The continued,
stable progression of the Somali political process depends heavily on
Al-Shabaab publicity missteps and on the security afforded by the
military.  The current relative peace afforded by the situation offers
Somalia the best chance at lasting peace since its descent into civil
war in 1991.

<!-- Military -->

The Somalia military by itself is not a driver of stability.  However,
the recent transnational operations under African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM) markedly increase the internal security of
Somalia. "AMISOM is mandated to conduct Peace Support Operations in
Somalia to stabilize the situation in the country in order to create
conditions for the conduct of Humanitarian activities and an immediate
take over by the United Nations."  [@amisom-13-mandate] AMISOM
consists of military personnel and police forces from Uganda,
Burundian, Djibouti, Sierra Leone, and Kenya. AMISOM's main adversary
is Al-Shabaab, translated as "The Youth".  Al-Shabaab is a terrorist
organization that recently joined Al-Queda. "Al-Shabaab's primary
objective is the creation of an Islamist state in Somalia,
administered according to its radical interpretation of sharia
(Islamic law)." [@janes-14-shabaab] Under the 22,000 strong force,
AMISOM drove Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu and out of the Kismayo Port,
eliminating a valuable source of income for Al-Shabaab.

The external nations bear the brunt of fighting, due to the clan
infighting in the Somali Army.  According to Fergusson, "the [Somali]
'army' is actually an uncertain alliance of clan militias incapable of
leading anything much. There have been stories of [Somali] troops
deserting their posts, and of shooting at each other instead of at
al-Shabaab. They are even suspected of selling the enemy their weapons
and ammunition."  [@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 230] The Somali Army
infighting is compounded by pay problems. In one case the military
went without pay for six months. [@janes-14-somali-army] The Somali
Army's consistent inability to fund their military degrades the
readiness of their force to near useless.  The level of trust in the
Somalia Army is perhaps best demonstrated by their performance at a
recent presidential review.  Before the ceremony, soldier's were
disarmed. [@janes-14-somali-army]

Despite the talent difference between members of AMISOM, other African
Union countries have a stake in the outcome of Somalia.  The rise of
terrorist organizations in Africa continues at a rapid rate.  Al-Queda
In the Maghreb and Boko Haram both operate in African and are allies
with Al-Shabaab. The AMISOM mission is an attempt to stem the flow of
extreme Islamist ideology into Africa.  As a survival mechanism,
Somali's often ally with terrorist groups.  The Somalia people are
ruthlessly pragmatic after 20 years of war, eschewing dogma for
survival.  A civilian adviser working with AMISOM noted, "a lot of
people [...] are pretending to be part of [Al-Shabaab's] religious
lifestyle so they can be accepted."  [@heaton-12-somalia] As
Al-Shabaab yields space to the AMISOM offensive, the people have
slowly pledged support for Somalia. In addition to military support,
AMISOM provided health-care services quickly curried favor amongst
locals.  Despite notices from Al-Shabaab threatening the removal of
participant's tongues for visiting the free clinics, Somalis
continued to receive arrive, often traveling distances exceeding 20
kilometers.  [@fergusson-13-outlaw, Location 630]

AMISOM has proven capable of defeating Al-Shabab and regaining
territory.  As AMISOM advances, the legitimacy of the Somali government
grows.  As long as the AMISOM charter is renewed every six months, the
Somali Army and its partner forces will continue to drive stability.

<!-- Physical Environment -->

The physical environment stabilizes Somalia stability because the
richness of natural resources and likelihood of oil within Somalia
attract foreign investment and spur economic. Somalia's strategic
location along approaches to Bab el Mandeb and the routes through the
red Sea and Suez canal are vital to world shipping.  [@cia-14-somalia]

The economic future of Somalia is speculative, but hopeful.  Somalia
is still an agricultural society, contributing 59% of the GDP and
employing 71% of the workforce.[@cia-14-somalia] However, Somalia
ranks in the bottom 15% of countries for arable land, with only 1.7%
of arable land.[@worldbank-2011-arable] The future of Somalia lies in
oil.  Fergusson notes that "Somalia possesses important [oil]
reserves, both in the north of the country and to the south off the
shore of Kismayo. With al Shabaab in retreat, the more adventurous
prospecting companies are already circling, bringing the promise of
massive foreign investment and, eventually, Gulf-style oil wealth to
this impoverished nation."  [@fergusson-13-independent]
