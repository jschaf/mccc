Stability in Somalia
====================

Stability and Somalia are words not often in close proximity.  Somalia
was the most failed stated 2008-2013 and ranks seconds in
2014.[@failed-states-14] With a checkered history, drivers of
stability in Somalia must be viewed as fledgling drivers of stability.
The three drivers of stability in Somalia are the political
environment, the fledgling military and the physical environment.  The
political environment stabilizes Somalia because the established
central government after 14 years of anarchy.  The military is a
stablizes Somalia by providing security under the African Union
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and slowly defeating the terrorist group
Al-Shabab.  The physical environment stablizes Somalia because of the
abundant natural resources and because of its strategic location in
the horn of Africa.


## Politics ##

Political stability was achieved after a years of constant conflict
and regime changes.  Though the newly formed XX govt of Somalia leads
the world in corruption, and is more correctly defined as a
Kleptocracy, signs indicate that politics in Somalia are on the rise.
Key international organizations, including the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank recognized Somali as a nation-state.  Several
countries formally reopened diplomatic channels with Somalia, to
include the United States.

There are serious hindrances to a unified Somalia.  Somalia, the
nation-state, is a loose concept that varies in the regions throughout
the concept.  Somaliland and Puntland are semi-autonomous regions that
ignore the whims of the central government.  Additionally, the
political process has not yet reached the level of decorum expected in
a modern state.

Fistfights frequently occured in the TFG Parliment parliament,
ocassionaly escalating to full brawls.  [@heaton-12-somalia] The
U.S. House of Representatives demonstrated similar behaviour in 1858,
in which over 30 members engaged in hand-to-hand
combat. [@ushouse-14-brawl]


The recent presedential election highlights the advances of the Somali
Governement.  A university professor usurped the incumbent, President
Sheikh Sharif despite the fact that Sharif spent $7 million in
bribes. [@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 114]

"The Taliban put great importance on getting their message across to
an international audience , and were prepared to take considerable
risks to do so. They understood that the continuation of Nato’s war
depended on Western public approval ratings, and that the foreign
media offered them their best opportunity to undermine
these. Al-Shabaab, by contrast, usually just wanted to shoot the
messenger. Their common assumption, almost a default position, was
that all journalists – even local ones – were traitors and
spies. Al-Shabaab knew, or thought they knew, that AMISOM had access
to CIA surveillance technology, and were paranoid about being
traced. This meant that there was no phone number a journalist could
call to request an interview, no email address to write to, and of
course no physical office to visit."

Nevertheless, the Somali blend of governance seems to work and it
matches the country that made it.  At least we're not overthrowing
their shah.  Member of the African Union.

# Military #

The Somalia military is not such much the driver of stability, but the
recent trans-national operations under AMISOM greatly contributed to
the internal security of Somalia.

"The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is mandated to conduct
Peace Support Operations in Somalia to stabilize the situation in the
country in order to create conditions for the conduct of Humanitarian
activities and an immediate take over by the United Nations (UN)."
[@amisom-13-mandate]

Under the 22,000 strong force, AMISOM drove Al-Shabab from Mogadishu
and XXXX.

Al-Shabaab, (the Mujahideen Youth Movement) is a terrorist
organization under the umbrella of Al-Queda. "Al-Shabaab's primary
objective is the creation of an Islamist state in Somalia,
administered according to its radical interpretation of sharia
(Islamic law)." [@janes-14-shabaab]

The Somalia people are ruthlessly pragmatic after 20 years of war,
eschewing dogma for survival.  A civilian advisor working with AMISOM
noted, "a lot of people I know who don't even pray are pretending to
be part of that religious lifestyle so they can be accepted."
[@heaton-12-somalia]

The people noticed the winning record of AMISOM and have given their
support.  The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) consists of
Uganda, Burundian, Djibouti, Sierra Leone, and Kenya.

In addition to military support, the healthcare services delivered by
the AMISOM quickly won approval of the populations.  Despite threats
from Al-Shabaab, and hours long queues, Somalias contined to recieve
medical treatment.[@fergusson-13-outlaw, Location 630]


The Somalia Army in and of itself lacks the capability to counter
insurgencies.

The truth, of course, is that the foreigners are running the offensive
– AMISOM versus Islamisom, as the local joke goes – because the TFG’s
‘army’ is actually an uncertain alliance of clan militias incapable of
leading anything much. There have been stories of TFG troops deserting
their posts, and of shooting at each other instead of at
al-Shabaab. They are even suspected of selling the enemy their weapons
and ammunition.  [@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 230]

Despite the talent difference between members of AMISOM, other African
Union countries have a stake in the outcome of Somalia.  The rise of
terrorist organizations in Africa continues at a startling rate,
including AQIM, al-Quaida In the Maghreb, Boko Haram (Books Forbidden
or Western education is sinful).  The AMISOM mission is an attempt to
stem the flow of extreme Islamist idealogy into Africa.
Frequent pay problems plague the military. In one case
the military went without pay for six months. [@janes-14-somali-army]
Additionally, the Army's lack of ability to pay Soldier consistently
leads to the decrease lethality and efficiency of the force.  The
level of trust in the Somalia Army is perhaps best explained by their
SOP for presidential review.  Soldier were disarmed for presidential
election. [@janes-14-somali-army] That said, AMISOM has proven
capability of defeating Al-Shabab and regaining territory.  As long as
AMISOM exists, the Somali Army will continue to drive stability.

# Physical Environment #

The physical environment is a driver of stability because of the
richness of natural resources and likelihood of oil within Somalia.  It
has the longest coastline in the the Africa.  The strategic location
along approaches to Bab el Mandeb and the routes through the red Sea
and Suez canal are vital to world shipping.

"Salvation will likely come from two directions. The first may be the
oil and gas sector. It has long been known that Somalia possesses
important reserves, both in the north of the country and to the south
off the shore of Kismayo. With al Shabaab in retreat, the more
adventurous prospecting companies are already circling, bringing the
promise of massive foreign investment and, eventually, Gulf-style oil
wealth to this impoverished nation." [@fergusson-13-independent]
