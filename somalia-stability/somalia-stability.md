Stability and Somalia are words not often in close proximity.  Somalia
ranked first on the most failed states list from 2008-2013 and
currently ranks second.  [@failed-states-14] With a checkered history,
drivers of stability in Somalia must be viewed as fledgling drivers of
stability.  The political environment, the military and the physical
environment drive stability in Somalia.  The political environment
stabilizes Somalia by providing a coherent, and internationally
recognized platform.  The military stabilizes Somalia by providing
security under the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and
slowly defeating the terrorist group Al-Shabab.  The physical
environment stabilizes Somalia because of the abundant natural
resources and because of its strategic location in the horn of Africa.


<!-- Politics -->

Political stability was achieved after two decades of constant
conflict and regime changes.  Though the newly formed XX govt of
Somalia leads the world in corruption, and is more correctly defined
as a Kleptocracy, signs indicate that politics in Somalia are on the
rise.  Key international organizations, including the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank recognized Somali as a nation-state.
Several countries formally reopened diplomatic channels with Somalia,
to include the United States.

There are serious hindrances to a unified Somalia.  Somalia, the
nation-state, is a loose concept that varies in the regions throughout
the concept.  Somaliland and Puntland are semi-autonomous regions that
ignore the whims of the central government.  EXPAND ON
PUNTLAND. Additionally, the political process has not yet reached the
level of decorum expected in a modern state. Fistfights frequently
occur in the parliament, occasionally escalating to full brawls. In
the last brawl, four representatives were admitted to the hospital
with head injuries. [@heaton-12-somalia] The US House of
Representatives demonstrated similar behavior in 1858, in which over
30 members engaged in hand-to-hand combat. [@ushouse-14-brawl]
Accordingly, the Somali political process should be viewed as early in
its lifetime.

The recent presidential election highlights the advances of the
political processes.  A university professor, Hassan Sheik Mohamud,
ousted the incumbent, Sheikh Sharif, in spite the fact that Sharif
spent $7 million in bribes to rig the election.
[@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 114] Shortly after securing the
presidency, Mohamud was named to the *Time 100* for his contributions
against corruption and his role in stabilizing the war torn
Somalia. [@kagame-13-time] President's Mohamud's success was greatly
eased by al-Shabaab publicity missteps.  James Fergusson, an
experienced reporter with time in Somalia and Afganistan, contrasted
the techniques of the Taliban and al-Shabaab:

> "The Taliban put great importance on getting their message across to
> an international audience, and were prepared to take considerable
> risks to do so. They understood that the continuation of NATO’s war
> depended on Western public approval ratings, and that the foreign
> media offered them their best opportunity to undermine
> these. Al-Shabaab, by contrast, usually just wanted to shoot the
> messenger. Their common assumption, almost a default position, was
> that all journalists-–even local ones-–were traitors and spies.
> [...] This meant that there was no phone number a journalist could
> call to request an interview, no email address to write to, and of
> course no physical office to visit."

The progression of the political process combined with al-Shabaab's
missteps and a relatively stable central government offers Somalia the
best chance at stable peace in 20 years.

<!-- Military -->

The Somalia military by itself is not a driver of stability.  However,
the recent transnational operations under African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM) greatly contributed to the internal security of
Somalia. "AMISOM is mandated to conduct Peace Support Operations in
Somalia to stabilize the situation in the country in order to create
conditions for the conduct of Humanitarian activities and an immediate
take over by the United Nations."  [@amisom-13-mandate] AMISOM
consists of military personnel and police forces from Uganda,
Burundian, Djibouti, Sierra Leone, and Kenya.

AMISOM's main opponent is Al-Shabaab, translated as "The Youth".
Al-Shabaab is a terrorist organization under the umbrella of
Al-Queda. "Al-Shabaab's primary objective is the creation of an
Islamist state in Somalia, administered according to its radical
interpretation of sharia (Islamic law)." [@janes-14-shabaab]
Under the 22,000 strong force, AMISOM drove Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu

The people noticed the winning record of AMISOM and have given their
support.   The external nations bear the brunt of fighting, due to the
clan infighting in the Somali Army.  According to Fergusson, "the
[Somali] 'army' is actually an uncertain alliance of clan militias
incapable of leading anything much. There have been stories of
[Somali] troops deserting their posts, and of shooting at each other
instead of at al-Shabaab. They are even suspected of selling the enemy
their weapons and ammunition."  [@fergusson-13-outlaw Location 230]
The Somali Army infighting is compounded by pay problems. In one case
the military went without pay for six months. [@janes-14-somali-army]
The Somali Army's consistent inability to pay Soldier consistently leads to
the decrease lethality and efficiency of the force.  The level of
trust in the Somalia Army is perhaps best explained by their SOP for
presidential review.  Soldier were disarmed for presidential
election. [@janes-14-somali-army]

Despite the talent difference between members of AMISOM, other African
Union countries have a stake in the outcome of Somalia.  The rise of
terrorist organizations in Africa continues at a startling rate.
Al-Queda In the Maghreb operates in nearby XXX.  Boko Haram
(translated as Western education is sinful) operates.  Both terrorist
organizations are allied with al-Shabaab.  The AMISOM mission is an
attempt to stem the flow of extreme Islamist ideology into Africa.

The Somalia people are ruthlessly pragmatic after 20 years of war,
eschewing dogma for survival.  A civilian adviser working with AMISOM
noted, "a lot of people I know who don't even pray are pretending to
be part of that religious lifestyle so they can be accepted."
[@heaton-12-somalia] In addition to military support, the health-care
services delivered by the AMISOM quickly won approval of the
populations.  Despite threats from Al-Shabaab, and hours long queues,
Somalis continued to receive medical treatment, often traveling
hundreds of kilometers.  [@fergusson-13-outlaw, Location 630]


AMISOM has proven capable of defeating Al-Shabab and regaining
territory.  As long as AMISOM charter is renewed every six months, the
Somali Army will continue to drive stability.

<!-- Physical Environment -->

The physical environment is a driver of stability because of the
richness of natural resources and likelihood of oil within Somalia.  It
has the longest coastline in the the Africa.  The strategic location
along approaches to Bab el Mandeb and the routes through the red Sea
and Suez canal are vital to world shipping.  [@cia-14-somalia]

"Salvation will likely come from two directions. The first may be the
oil and gas sector. It has long been known that Somalia possesses
important reserves, both in the north of the country and to the south
off the shore of Kismayo. With al Shabaab in retreat, the more
adventurous prospecting companies are already circling, bringing the
promise of massive foreign investment and, eventually, Gulf-style oil
wealth to this impoverished nation." [@fergusson-13-independent]
