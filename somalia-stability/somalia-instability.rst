Professor Jennifer Sciubba, a demographer and adviser to the US
Department of Defence, said recently. (She was talking about

In 2011, according to the World Health Organization , nearly half of
Somali victims of weapons-related injuries were children under the age
of five. An entire generation of Somalis had grown up knowing that
they could be violently killed, at random, at any time. Fatalism of
the deepest, darkest kind was inevitable in such a place – and who
knew what long-term effect that might have on a person’s mental
well-being? [@fergusson_worlds_2013, 650]


"A radio station run by Somalia's al-Shabab Islamist group has awarded
weapons to children who won a Koran-reciting and general knowledge
contest. Andulus radio, based near Mogadishu, gave the group which won
first prize in the Ramadan competition an AK-47 rifle and the
equivalent of $700 (£450). The second prize-winners received an AK-47
and $500, while the third prize was two hand grenades and $400." [@bbc_weapons_2011]
