The three drivers of stability in Somalia are Political, Military and
the physical environment.  The political environment is a driver of
stability because the Somalia finally established a central government
after 14 years.  The military is a driver of stability because AMISOM
has handily defeated Al-Shabab and secured the public trust in the
military.  The physical environment is a driver of stability because
Somalia possesses rich natural resources and a strategic location in
the horn of Africa.

Stability and somalia are words not often paired together.  Somalia
topped the Failed States Index for the previous three years, and
finished in the top 1- for the last XX years.  With a checkered
history, drivers of stability in Somalia must be viewed as fledgling
drivers of stability, not Michael Schumaker.

Political stability was achieved after a lont 14 years of constanst
conflict and regieme changes.  Though the newly formed XX govt of
Somalia leads the world in corruption, and is more correctly defined
as a Kleptocracy, signs indicate that politics in Somalia are on the
rise.  Key international organizations recognized Somali as a
nation-state including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
World Bank.  Key nation-states formally reopened diplomatic channels
with Somalia, to include the United States.  That said, there are
serious hindrances to a unified somalia.  Somalia, the nation-state,
is a loose concept that varies in the regions throughout the concept.
Somaliland and Puntland are semi-autonomous regions that ignore the
whims of the central government.  Additionally, the political process
has not yet reached the level of decorum expected in a modern state.
Fist-fights frequently liven the day in the parliment, akin to the
good ole days in 1812 where Andrew Jackson would beat the shit outta
people.  Nevertheless, the Somali blend of governance seems to work
and it matches the country that made it.  At least we're not
overthrowing their shah.  Member of the African Union.

The Somalia military is not such much the driver of stability, but the
recent trans-national operations under AMISOM greatly contributed to
the internal security of Somalia.  Under the 22,000 strong force,
AMISOM drove Al-Shabab from Mogadishu and XXXX.  The Somalia people,
pragmatic after 20 years of war, recognize the winning record of
AMISOM and have given their support.  The African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM) consists of Uganda, Burndian, Dijbouti, Sierra Leone,
and Kenya.  The Somalia Army in and of itself lacks the capability to
counter insurgencies.  Additionally, the Army's lack of ability to pay
Soldier consistenlty leads to the decrease lethality and efficiency of
the force.  The level of trust in the Somalia Army is perhaps best
explained by their SOP for presidential review.  Soldier were disarmed
for presidential election.  That said, AMISOM has proven capability of
defeating Al-Shabab and regaining territory.  As long as AMISOM
exists, the Somali Army will continue to drive stability.

The physical environment is a driver of stability becuase of the
richness of natural resources and liklihood of oil within Somalia.  It
has the longest coastline in the the Arfrica.  The strategic location
along approaches to Bab el Mandeb and the routes through the red Sea
and Suez canal are vital to wrold shipping.
