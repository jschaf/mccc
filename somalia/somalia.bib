regime change and democratization) as central motivations for the Arab Spring
revolutions of 2011. However, the Arab world is currently experiencing massive
demographic crises, and policy makers must acknowledge the cultural pressures
that have left this young generation trapped in a pre-adulthood phase of social
status that prevents them from becoming fully engaged with Arab society. The
inability of youth to access the opportunities promised in the social contract of
adulthood—including quality education, viable employment, and marriage and
family formation—has led to massive resentment motivating youth to actively seek
change within their country and region. Countries which do not begin to address
the cultural sources of youth frustration will find themselves vulnerable to continued
unrest long after the Arab Spring dissipates, while the current youth generation
runs the risk of becoming socially displaced in a region experiencing rapid economic

This lack of viable education and employment opportunities – in addition to clan and cultural prejudices – has created a high level of frustration and discontentment among young people.

@report{chaaban-08-exclusion,
  abstract = {This paper explores the costs associated with youth exclusion in the Middle East by providing estimates of the economic costs to society related to youth unemployment, youth joblessness, school dropouts, adolescent pregnancy, and youth migration. The paper provides country-specific estimates of the costs of youth exclusion by using the human capital approach to valuing economic costs. In addition, the paper develops a new empirical methodology that benchmarks the costs of youth exclusion in Middle Eastern countries against a common hypothetical international “best-practice frontier” in which the overall costs of youth exclusion are com- parable across countries. Results show that youth exclusion poses major economic costs to Middle Eastern societies, reaching in 2006 as high as US\$53 billion in Egypt and about US\$1.5 billion in Jordan. Moreover, Middle Eastern countries are among the group furthest away from the best practice frontier as it relates to reducing youth exclusion, and their performance has deteriorated in recent years. Middle Eastern countries could decrease youth exclu- sion by at least 60 percent if they were to use their available resources more efficiently.},

Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been driven to the edge of starvation by the group's blockades against Western food aid. And they're tired of war.

For example, encouraging a youth to leave home and join a military or paramilitary organization can be (1) couched in patriotic terms if the youth’s family is a member of a privileged class, or (2) framed as a step in social advancement if the family is immigrant and struggling, or (3) characterized as a revolutionary act of self-discovery if the family is disapproving and must be circumvented. These are simple generic examples of ‘‘tuning’’ the pitch to the psychographic2 and demographic3 particulars of the audience and its environment.

"Economically, Mogadishu was fragmented during the long period of civil war with Warlords from various majority sub-clans controlling large swathes of resources and imposing illegal taxes through numerous informal roadblocks. This caused high fragmentation of the city into different zones according to clan settlements and thus had high negative impact on the growth of the economy due to restricted movement of people and resources. The situation was further exacerbated by the long ban on livestock export to the Middle East particularly the Arab world which further skewed the balance of trade as Somalia was a major exporter of livestock. Persistent drought further worsened the already precarious situation as large number of pastoralist dropouts moved mainly to Mogadishu in search of relief assistance. Apart from women and children, the hardest hit members of the community have been the youth who out of desperation have in most cases been recruited as militias by a succession of power and money hungry illegal groupings."

A decade after 9/11, the war on terror has entered a new phase and, it would seem, a new territory. In early 2010, Al Qaeda operatives were reportedly “streaming” out of central Asia toward Somalia and the surrounding region.Somalia, now home to some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists, was already the world’s most failed state. Two decades of anarchy have spawned not just Islamic extremism but piracy, famine, and a seemingly endless clan-based civil war that has killed an estimated 500,000, turned millions into refugees, and caused hundreds of thousands more to flee and settle in Europe and North America.What is now happening in Somalia directly threatens the security of the world, possibly more than any other region on earth. James Fergusson’s book is the first accessible account of how Somalia became the world’s most dangerous place and what we can—and should—do about it.},
