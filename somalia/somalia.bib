A decade after 9/11, the war on terror has entered a new phase and, it would seem, a new territory. In early 2010, Al Qaeda operatives were reportedly “streaming” out of central Asia toward Somalia and the surrounding region.Somalia, now home to some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists, was already the world’s most failed state. Two decades of anarchy have spawned not just Islamic extremism but piracy, famine, and a seemingly endless clan-based civil war that has killed an estimated 500,000, turned millions into refugees, and caused hundreds of thousands more to flee and settle in Europe and North America.What is now happening in Somalia directly threatens the security of the world, possibly more than any other region on earth.

@inproceedings{mulderig-13-frustration,
  abstract = {Many scholars have focused on the political factors (in particular, the desire for
regime change and democratization) as central motivations for the Arab Spring
revolutions of 2011. However, the Arab world is currently experiencing massive
demographic crises, and policy makers must acknowledge the cultural pressures
that have left this young generation trapped in a pre-adulthood phase of social
status that prevents them from becoming fully engaged with Arab society. The
inability of youth to access the opportunities promised in the social contract of
adulthood—including quality education, viable employment, and marriage and
family formation—has led to massive resentment motivating youth to actively seek
change within their country and region. Countries which do not begin to address
the cultural sources of youth frustration will find themselves vulnerable to continued
unrest long after the Arab Spring dissipates, while the current youth generation
runs the risk of becoming socially displaced in a region experiencing rapid economic
and cultural development.},

@report{chaaban-08-exclusion,
  abstract = {This paper explores the costs associated with youth exclusion in the Middle East by providing estimates of the economic costs to society related to youth unemployment, youth joblessness, school dropouts, adolescent pregnancy, and youth migration. The paper provides country-specific estimates of the costs of youth exclusion by using the human capital approach to valuing economic costs. In addition, the paper develops a new empirical methodology that benchmarks the costs of youth exclusion in Middle Eastern countries against a common hypothetical international “best-practice frontier” in which the overall costs of youth exclusion are com- parable across countries. Results show that youth exclusion poses major economic costs to Middle Eastern societies, reaching in 2006 as high as US\$53 billion in Egypt and about US\$1.5 billion in Jordan. Moreover, Middle Eastern countries are among the group furthest away from the best practice frontier as it relates to reducing youth exclusion, and their performance has deteriorated in recent years. Middle Eastern countries could decrease youth exclu- sion by at least 60 percent if they were to use their available resources more efficiently.},
