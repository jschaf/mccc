The root cause of instability in Somalia is poor investment in human
development.  The United Nations defines human development as
equipping people with the "capabilities and opportunities they need to
make choices to improve their lives." Somalia's instability is
reflected by its human development index, ranked at 165 of 170
countries. [@undp-12-development, *xviii*]  The drivers of this
instability are a neglected health and education infrastructure, a
weak economy and an excluded youth social group.  The derelict health
and education infrastructure reduces human capital and increases the
population's vulnerability to recruiting efforts by extremist groups.
The Government's weak control of the formal economy drives instability
as disorganized financial management excludes youth business
opportunities and employment. The limited opportunities offered by
education and the economy frustrate Somali youth as they struggle to
mature into adulthood, providing a fertile ground for youth
radicalization.

<!-- Infrastructure -->

Somalia's health and education infrastructure is among the worst in
the world.  Infant mortality is 108 deaths per 1000 births and child
mortality is 178 deaths per 1000 children, ranking third highest in
the world. [@cia-14-somalia] The lack of external aid exacerbates the
problem.  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in North America as
Doctors Without Borders, departed Somalia in August 2013 after two
workers were released after being held hostage for almost two years.
The release was the breaking point amidst dozens of previous instances
of violence.  Since first arriving to Somalia in 1991, 14 MSF staff
members have been killed.  To protect their workers MSF hired armed
guards, providing Somalia the solemn distinction of being the only
country in which the MSF employed armed guards. [@msf-13-closed]
Assistance from MSF was desperately needed to prop up existing
infrastructure. In 2012, "MSF teams provided more than 624,000 medical
consultations, admitted 41,100 people to hospitals, helped deliver
7,300 babies, immunized 58,000 people, and treated 30,000 malnourished
children."  [@msf-13-closed] The lack of medical care and decreased
coverage from MSF's departure dramatically increased the population
vulnerability.

A study by the RAND corporation researched Al-Queda terrorist
selection and recruitment techniques.  The research is applicable to
Somalia because al-Shabaab, the major terrorist group in Somalia,
operates as an affiliate of al-Queda. [@janes-14-shabaab] RAND found
that al-Queda recruiters tailor messages to match their audience and
environment. Al-Queda targets individuals with "a high level of
current distress or dissatisfaction (emotional, physical, or both)"
[@daly-06-recruitment, 85] The increased vulnerability and distress
caused by inadequate medical care leaves many Somalis susceptible to
terrorist recruiting campaigns, destabilizing internal security.

Education infrastructure collapsed in 1991 along with Siad Barre's
Somali Democratic Republic because the taxation needed for public
funding dissolved.  Somalia has been slow to recover.  Only 4.5
percent of Somali children attend secondary school.  The reasons for
the low enrollment rate include the inability to pay private school
fees (87.2 percent), marriage (49.5 percent), distance to the school
(28.4 percent) and a familial requirement to work at home (27.5
percent). [@unesco-08-secondary] The lack of schooling harms Somali
economic growth.  A comprehensive report by the U.N. on 100 countries
over 35 years "showed that economic growth is directly related to
achievements in secondary schooling." [@undp-12-development, 6]

The failings of Somali education infrastructure deprive Somali youth
of the opportunity to grow and transition into adulthood.  Somali
youth are well aware of the universal right to education.  The
U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone has
the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the
elementary and fundamental stages." [@un-48-udhr, Article 26]  A 2012
U.N. human development report found that 82 percent of Somalis knew
that they had a right to primary education. [@undp-12-development, 53]
The same U.N. report examined levels of youth frustration using
factors such as "poor governance and justice" and "no outlets to
express aspiration and need".  The overall frustration index for
Somali youth was 3.96 of 5, where 5 is most frustrated.  The gap
between the right to universal education and the current Somali
implementation frustrates youth by blocking their transition to
adulthood.  The blocked transition and frustration provide a seam that
terrorist recruiters may exploit.

<!-- Economic -->

The economy drives instability by excluding youth from business
opportunities and employment. The African Developmental Bank Group
(ADBG) is a financial institution that promotes economic and human
development in Africa, and financed over $4 billion in improvement
projects in 2013. [@adbg-14-about] A country brief written by ADBG
found that many of Somalia's financial difficulties are related to its
nascent central banking system.  The Somali Central bank was
reestablished in 2009 with a $2 million grant from ADBG.  Though
Somalia established a number of historic firsts, including the first
national budget in two decades, disorganized public finance management
hinders human development.  The Somali Central Bank has not yet
implemented a national monetary policy.  Until the Central Bank takes
charge of monetary policy and implements a formal tax policy,
inflation is expected to remain near 300 percent, and profitable
businesses will continue to operate untaxed.  The net result is a poor
revenue base that leaves Somalia reliant on external aid to improve
their infrastructure and business
climate. [@adbg-13-somalia, 2, Annex 11 *xvi*]

One consequence of the lackluster business climate is a saturated job
market.  The highest level of youth frustration in the U.N. human
development report was the lack of employment opportunities.  The
frustration is understandable as overall unemployment stands at 54
percent and youth unemployment is a staggering 67 percent.
[@undp-12-development, *xx*] The high unemployment rate blocks youth
from reaching adulthood by excluding them from the labor market.  The
cost of youth economic exclusion is well studied.  Dr. Chaaban, an
economics professor at the American University of Beirut, showed that
the cost of youth exclusion exceeded 17 percent of GDP in Egypt ($53
billion) and 7 percent of GDP in Jordan ($1.5 billion).  For
comparison, the total value of Egypt's agricultural sector is
equivalent to the cost of Egypt's youth
exclusion. [@chaaban-08-exclusion, 18]  Similar statistics are
unavailable for Somalia because the last reliable socio-economic
survey was published in 2004.  Due to the dearth of statistics, ADBG
noted that "it is almost impossible to undertake planning and
programming work" or "monitor economic and social developments."
[@adbg-13-somalia, Annex 4 *iv*]  As a consequence, the effect of
various improvement programs cannot be measured and private investment
firms look to more well studied countries, further suppressing job
growth.  As with education, the 2012 U.N. human development report
showed that the majority of Somali youth (71 percent) recognize that
they have right to decent work as defined by the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. [@undp-12-development, 53]  The financial missteps of
the Somali government exclude Somali youth from business
opportunities, increasing the vulnerability and frustration of the
youth.

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because the frustration
harbored by the large youth population predisposes them towards
radicalization.  The U.N.  Human Development Report described the
causes and effects of social issues as such:

> Lost opportunities, unclear identity and a growing sense of
> marginalization among youth in an environment of state collapse,
> violent conflict and economic decline provide fertile ground for
> youth radicalization.  The same reasons that have pushed young
> Somalis to join Al-Shabaab have also drawn them to join street
> gangs. [@undp-12-development, 2]

The overarching problem faced by Somali youth is the difficult
transition into adulthood.  As over 70 percent of Somalis are under
the age of 30, the problem is both broad and consequential.  The
transition into adulthood is difficult because of "social, economic
and political exclusions" related to "cultural affiliations, gender,
age, illiteracy and poverty."  The exclusions diminish the
opportunities available to youth and increase their
frustration. [@undp-12-development, *xix*]  The frustration opens
youth up to terrorist recruiting messages.  Al-Queda specifically
targets "cultural disillusionment in a frustrated seeker (i.e.,
unfulfilled idealism)" as a factor in
recruitment. [@daly-06-recruitment, 85]

<!-- Conclusion -->

The problems facing Somalia are not unique.  A large youth population,
youth unemployment and poor education opportunities were all major
causes of the Arab Spring.  Mary Mulderig, a cultural anthropologist,
studied the commonalities between the Arab Spring movements, noting
that combination of factors including "a youth bulge, massive youth
unemployment, increasing quantity but decreasing quality of education
[...]  translates into a massive societal problem not seen to this
extreme elsewhere." [@mulderig-13-frustration, pg 26] Somalia,
however, easily eclipses many of the statistics associated with the
Arab Spring.  A youth population exceeding 70 percent coupled with a
youth unemployment rate of 67 percent bodes poorly for Somalia's
future.  Youth exclusion perpetrated through economic and political
avenues drives youth toward radicalization.  The future of Somalia
lies in its youth.  To maintain the current tenuous stability, Somalia
must prioritize human development of its youth through improvements in
infrastructure and the economy.
