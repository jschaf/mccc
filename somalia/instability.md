Somalia's youth population is hardened by decades of war, scorned by
limited economic opportunities and disadvantaged by failing
infrastructure.  The drivers of instability in Somalia are the failing
infrastructure and stagnant economy which work to exclude Somalia's
large youth social group, defined as ages 14-29.  Somalia's
nonexistent health and education infrastructure limit opportunities for
the youth populace to escape conflict.  The economy is burdened with
high unemployment and rampant inflation, and excludes youth from
joining legitimate business enterprises.  Somali youth, comprising
almost half the population, drive instability by turning their
frustration against the government, threatening to replay the events
of the Arab Spring.  The future of Somalia lies in their youth and
Somalia is failing them.


<!-- Infrastructure -->

Somalia's health and education facilities are among the worst in the
world.  Infant mortality is 108 deaths per 1000 births and child
mortality is 178 deaths per 1000 children, ranking third highest in
the world. [@cia-14-somalia] [@adbg-13-somalia] The lack of external
aid exacerbates the problem.  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in
North America as Doctors Without Borders, departed Somalia in August
2013 after two workers were finally released after being held hostage
for almost two years.  The incident was the breaking point amidst
dozens of previous incidents.  Since MSF first arrived to Somalia in
1991, 14 staff members were killed.  To protect their workers MSF
hired armed guards, providing Somalia the solemn distinction of being
the only country in which the MSF use armed guards. [@msf-13-closed]
Assistance from MSF is desperately needed to prop up existing
infrastructure. In 2012, "MSF teams provided more than 624,000 medical
consultations, admitted 41,100 people to hospitals, helped deliver
7,300 babies, immunized 58,000 people, and treated 30,000 malnourished
children."  [@msf-13-closed]

<!-- So what about MSF -->

Public education facilities collapsed in 1991 along with Siad Barre's
Somali Democratic Republic.  Somalia has been slow to recover.  Only
4.5 percent of Somali children attend secondary school.  The reasons
for the low enrollment rate include the inability to pay private school
fees (87.2 percent), marriage (49.5 percent), distance to the school
(28.4 percent) and a familial requirement to work at home (27.5
percent). [@unesco-08-secondary] The lack of schooling limits economic
prospects.  "Research on 100 countries from 1960 to 1995 showed that
economic growth is directly related to achievements in secondary
schooling." [@undp-12-development, 6] Somali children understand
they have a right to universal education.  The gap between theory and
practice creates resentment among youth.

The failings of Somali infrastructure deprive Somali youth of the
opportunity to grow and transition into adulthood.  Somali youth are
well aware of their right to education; 82 percent acknowledged their
right to primary education and access to secondary
school. [@undp-12-development, 53] The failings of Somali public
education are painfully obvious to the youth population, increasing
their frustration as they struggle to transition to adulthood.

<!-- Economic -->

The economy drives instability by excluding youth from business
opportunity and employment.  Overall unemployment stands at 54 percent
whereas youth unemployment is a staggering 67 percent.  The economy is
dominated by the informal sector because 20 years of war have
fragmented the country, making trade between regions difficult.
[@adbg-13-somalia, 21] Continued violence compounds the problem by
preventing the accurate measurement of economic statistics.
Statistics which are necessary for planning by aid groups and private
investors. [@adbg-13-somalia, 2] The Somali Central Bank does not
control the currency, cannot tax businesses and finances deficits
through money printing.  The effect of the central banks management is
rampant inflation in the range of 300 percent and an inability to pay
their own civil servants.  [@adbg-13-somalia, 3]

A youth survey conducted by the United Nations measured the level of
frustration and cited lack of employment as the greatest
frustration. [@undp-12-development, *xx*] The cost of youth economic
exclusion is well studied.  "The total cost of youth exclusion [...]
can reach a staggering 17.4 percent of GDP in Egypt [$53 billion] and
nearly 7.3 percent of GDP in Jordan [$1.5 billion]."  The cost of
youth exclusion in Egypt is equivalent to the value of Egypt's
agricultural sector. [@chaaban-08-exclusion, 18] As with education, the
majority of Somali youth (71 percent) recognize their right to decent
work.  The financial missteps of the Somali government exclude Somali
youth from fulfilling their potential.

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because the large youth
population's frustration turns them towards radicalization.  The U.N.
Human Development Report described the crux of social issues in
Somalia:

> Lost opportunities, unclear identity and a growing sense of
> marginalization among youth in an environment of state collapse,
> violent conflict and economic decline provide fertile ground for
> youth radicalization.  The same reasons that have pushed young
> Somalis to join Al-Shabaab have also drawn them to join street
> gangs. [@undp-12-development, 2]

The root cause for many of the problems is Somalia's poor investment
in human development.  Human development is equipping people with the
"capabilities and opportunities they need to make choices to improve
their lives."  Somalia’s Human Development Index is among the lowest
in the world, ranked at 165 of 170
countries. [@undp-12-development, *xviii*]

"Over 70 percent of Somalis are under the age of 30; most face blocked
transitions to adulthood due to multiple social, economic and
political exclusions. These are related to clan and cultural
affiliations, gender, age, illiteracy and poverty, among other
factors. They have been reinforced by dominant social attitudes and
prejudicial cultural practices, and perpetuated by violence. Exclusion
limits capabilities and opportunities, and constricts the
contributions of youth to peace building and development. It also
dampens the natural energy and enthusiasm of youth, and systematically
hinders their potential for positive advancement."
[@undp-12-development, *xix*]


<!-- Conclusion -->

Mary Mulderig, a cultural anthropologist, noted that the problems
causing the Arab Spring are not unique to the Arab world.  "A youth
bulge, massive youth unemployment, increasing quantity but decreasing
quality of education [...]  translates into a massive societal problem
not seen to this extreme elsewhere."[@mulderig-13-frustration, pg 26]
Somalia, however, easily eclipses the problems of the Gulf states and
their Arab Spring.  Whereas the Gulf States struggled with a 10
percent unemployment rate, Somalia is debilitated with a 67 percent
unemployment rate.  Somalia stands at the precipice of disaster,
clutching stability anchored only by the recent, feeble gains in the
political and military environments.
