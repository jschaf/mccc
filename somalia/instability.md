Somali is a country in turmoil attempting to rise to stability on the
recent succes of AMMISOM.  Restless men start wars.  AMISOM has pushed
al-Shabaab to the brink of defeat but the combined weight of decades
of war threaten to bring the country back to strife.  The three
drivers of instability in Somalia are the infrastructure, the economic
situation and the social situaion.  Somali infrastructure,
specifically the lack of health facilities and education facilities
limit and frustrate opportunites for the youth populace.  The economic
situation is underdeveloped; high unemployment, rampant inflation
coupled with a saturated job market exclude youth from joining
legitmate enterprises and towards extremism.  The social scene is a
massive time bomb.  Somali youth, almost half the population, drive
instability by being frustrated by the lack of opportunities and turn
to violence in response to frustration.  The key to the future of
Somalia lies in their youth.


<!-- Infrastructure -->

The lack of health and education facilities threaten Somali stability
by eroding opportunites for Somalis to enter the job market.

Somalia's health facilites are among the worst in the world.  Infant
mortality is 108 per 1000 and child mortality is
178 \cite{adbg-13-somalia pg ?}  Doctors without borders left due the
detiorating security situation after several doctors were taken
hostage  \cite{pflanz-13-doctors}

Eduation facilities collapsed in 1991 with the rise of Sid Barre and
have not yet recovered.  Only ? percent attend secondary school.  ?
percent cite school fees imposed by the privately run schools as
reasons for not attending.  The lack of schooling limits economic
prospects.  A study of over 100 countries found that secondary school
was tied directly to ecnomic growth CITE??.

<!-- Economic -->

The economic situation drives instability because the high
unemployment, lack of business opportunitei and lack of public finance
management exclude youth from economic opportunties.

Somalia has 54% overall unemployment with youth (ag 14-29
)unemployment at 67%.  The economy is dominated by the informal sector
because 20 years of war have fragmented the country.
\cite{adbg-13-somalia, pg 2}  Continued violence prevents accurate
measurement of economic statistics which prevent planning by outside
groups \cite{adbg-13-somalia}

The Somali Central Bank was reestablished in 2009 cite??? and has not
yet mastered public finance management.  Somalia is unable to levy
taxes even on the most profitable businesses.

The cost of the lack of economic opportunites is high.  The UN thingy
estimates it at $53B in Egypt, 17 percent of GDP, $7B in Jordan 7
percent of GDP.

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because a large youth
population is frustrated by the lack of opportunity and turns to
violence.

Youth make up 42 percent of the population.  60 percent of them
expressed an intent to flee the country and join the large diaspora.
The frustration index is ?? which compares to other countries.  The
youth population expects the right to education and healthcare, rights
that have not been met in over 20 years.

The large refugee population and diaspora which fail to integrate into
the populace serve as fertile ground for terrorist recruiters


<!-- Conclusion -->

The restless men of of Somalia grow weary of your incompetence and
will not hesitate to turn to violence.  The social, economic dynamic
and infrastructure are chained together.  One cannot rise without the
others.  As Somalia picks its way to peace, it is presented with the
complex task of securing peace through three different channels and
consolidating on the gains hard-won by AMISOM.
