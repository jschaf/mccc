Restless men start wars.  Somaia's youth population is hardened by
decades of war, scorned by limited economic opportunites and
disadvantaged by failing infrastructure.  The restless Somalis
threaten to plunge the country back into turmoil.  The three drivers
of instability in Somalia are the failing infrastructure, the stagnant
economy and the excluded social group.  Somali health and education
infrastructure limit opportunites for the youth populace to escape
conflict.  The economy is burdened with high unemployment and rampant
inflation, and excludes youth from joining legitmate business
enterprises.  Somali youth, comprising almost half the population,
drive instability by the simple virtue that there is no escaping the
bleak outlook.  The future of Somalia lies in their youth and Somalia
is failing them.


<!-- Infrastructure -->

Somalia's health and education facilites are among the worst in the
world.  Infant mortality is 108 deaths per 1000 births and child
mortality is 178 deaths per 1000 children, ranking third highest in
the world. [@cia-14-somalia] [@adbg-13-somalia]

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in North America as Doctors
Without Borders, left Somalia in August 2013 after two workers were
held released after being held hostage for almost two years.  The
incident was the breaking point admist dozens of previous incidents.
Since MSF first arrived to Somalia in 1991, 14 staff membersw were
killed.  To protect their workers MSF hired armed guards, providing
Somalia the solemn distinction of being the only country in which the
MSF use armed guards. [@msf-13-closed] Assistance from MSF is desperately
needed to prop up existing infrastructure. In 2012, "MSF teams
provided more than 624,000 medical consultations, admitted 41,100
people to hospitals, helped deliver 7,300 babies, immunized 58,000
people, and treated 30,000 malnourished children." [@msf-13-closed]

Public eduation facilities collapsed in 1991 along with Siad Barre's
Somali Democratic Republic.  Somalia has been slow to recover.
Currently, only 4.5 percent of Somali children attend secondary
school.  The reasons for the low enrollment rate include inability to
pay private school fees (87.2 percent), marriage (49.5 percent),
distance to the school (28.4 percent) and a familia requirment to work
at home (27.5 percent). [@unesco-08-secondary] The lack of schooling
limits economic prospects.  "Research on 100 countries from 1960 to
1995 showed that economic growth is directly related to achievements
in secondary schooling." [@undp-12-development, pg 6] Somali children
understand they have a right to universal education.  The gap between
theory and practice creates resentment among youth.  A youth survey
conducted by the United Nations measured the level of frustration.

<!-- Economic -->

The economy drives instability because the lack of business
opportunities exclude youth from economic opportunties.

Overall unemployment stands at 54 percent whereas youth unemployment
(age 14-29) is a staggering 67 percent.  The economy is dominated by
the informal sector because 20 years of war have fragmented the
country, making trade between regions difficult.
[@adbg-13-somalia, pg 2] Continued violence compounds the problem by
preventing the accurate measurement of economic statistics.
Statistics which are necessary for planning by aid groups and private
investors. [@adbg-13-somalia]

The Somali Central Bank was reestablished in 2009 cite??? and has not
yet mastered public finance management.  Somalia is unable to levy
taxes even on the most profitable businesses, leaving them unable to
pay even their own civil serveants.

The cost of economic exclusion for the youth population opportunites
is high.  The UN thingy estimates it at $53 billion in Egypt, 17 percent of
GDP, $7 billion in Jordan, or 7 percent of GDP. [@undp-12-development]

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because a large youth
population is frustrated by the lack of opportunity and turns to
violence.

Youth make up 42 percent of the population.  60 percent of them
expressed an intent to flee the country and join the large diaspora.
The frustration index is ?? which compares to other countries.  The
youth population expects the right to education and healthcare, rights
that have not been met in over 20 years.

The large refugee population and diaspora which fail to integrate into
the populace serve as fertile ground for terrorist recruiters


<!-- Conclusion -->

The restless men of of Somalia grow weary of your incompetence and
will not hesitate to turn to violence.  The social, economic dynamic
and infrastructure are chained together.  One cannot rise without the
others.  As Somalia picks its way to peace, it is presented with the
complex task of securing peace through three different channels and
consolidating on the gains hard-won by AMISOM.

Tie them together, social linked to infrastructure and economy.
