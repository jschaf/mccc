Somaia's youth population is hardened by decades of war, scorned by
limited economic opportunites and disadvantaged by failing
infrastructure.  The drivers of instability in Somalia are the failing
infrastructure and stagnant economy which work to exclude Somalia's
large youth social group, defined as age 14-29.  Somalia's nonexistent
health and education infrastructure limit opportunites for the youth
populace to escape conflict.  The economy is burdened with high
unemployment and rampant inflation, and excludes youth from joining
legitmate business enterprises.  Somali youth, comprising almost half
the population, drive instability by turning their frustration against
the government, replaying the events of the Arab Spring.  The future
of Somalia lies in their youth and Somalia is failing them.


<!-- Infrastructure -->

Somalia's health and education facilites are among the worst in the
world.  Infant mortality is 108 deaths per 1000 births and child
mortality is 178 deaths per 1000 children, ranking third highest in
the world. [@cia-14-somalia] [@adbg-13-somalia] The lack of external
aid exacerbates the problem.  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in
North America as Doctors Without Borders, departed Somalia in August
2013 after two workers were finally released after being held hostage
for almost two years.  The incident was the breaking point admist
dozens of previous incidents.  Since MSF first arrived to Somalia in
1991, 14 staff members were killed.  To protect their workers MSF
hired armed guards, providing Somalia the solemn distinction of being
the only country in which the MSF use armed guards. [@msf-13-closed]
Assistance from MSF is desperately needed to prop up existing
infrastructure. In 2012, "MSF teams provided more than 624,000 medical
consultations, admitted 41,100 people to hospitals, helped deliver
7,300 babies, immunized 58,000 people, and treated 30,000 malnourished
children."  [@msf-13-closed]

Public eduation facilities collapsed in 1991 along with Siad Barre's
Somali Democratic Republic.  Somalia has been slow to recover.  Only
4.5 percent of Somali children attend secondary school.  The reasons
for the low enrollment rate include the inability to pay private school
fees (87.2 percent), marriage (49.5 percent), distance to the school
(28.4 percent) and a familial requirement to work at home (27.5
percent). [@unesco-08-secondary] The lack of schooling limits economic
prospects.  "Research on 100 countries from 1960 to 1995 showed that
economic growth is directly related to achievements in secondary
schooling." [@undp-12-development, 6] Somali children understand
they have a right to universal education.  The gap between theory and
practice creates resentment among youth.

The failings of Somali infrastructure deprive Somali youth of the
opportunity to grow and transition into adulthood.  Somali youth are
well aware of their right to education with 82 percent acknowledging
their right.[@undp-12-development, 53]  The failings of Somali public
education are painfully obvious to the youth population, driving
frustration.

<!-- Economic -->

The economy drives instability by excluding youth from business
opportunties. Overall unemployment stands at 54 percent whereas youth
unemployment is a staggering 67 percent.  The economy is
dominated by the informal sector because 20 years of war have
fragmented the country, making trade between regions difficult.
[@adbg-13-somalia, 21] Continued violence compounds the problem by
preventing the accurate measurement of economic statistics.
Statistics which are necessary for planning by aid groups and private
investors. [@adbg-13-somalia]

The Somali Central Bank was reestablished in 2009 cite??? and has not
yet mastered public finance management.  Somalia is unable to levy
taxes even on the most profitable businesses, leaving them unable to
pay even their own civil serveants.

A youth survey conducted by the United Nations measured the level of
frustration and cited lack of employment as the greatest
frustration. [@undp-12-development, xx]

"The total cost of youth exclusion, as measured by this paper, can
reach a staggering 17.4 percent of GDP in Egypt and nearly 7.3 percent
of GDP in Jordan. The cost of youth exclusion in Egypt is as high as
the total value-added of Egypt’s agricultural sector, close to 17
percent of GDP." [@chaaban-08-exclusion, 18]

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because the large youth
population's frustration turns them towards radicalization.  The UN
Human Development Report reports that "Lost opportunities, unclear
identity and a growing sense of marginalization among youth in an
environment of state collapse, vilolent conflict and economic decline
provide fertile ground for youth radicaliazation.  The same reasons
that have pushed young Somalis to join Al-Shabaab have also drawn them
to join street gangs." [@undp-12-development, 2]

"Human development equips people with the capabilities and
opportunities they need to make choices to improve their
lives."[@undp-12-development, xviii] Somalia’s Human Development
Index (HDI) value is strikingly low at 0.285 (Annex 2). If
internationally comparable date were available, Somalia would probably
rank among the lowest in the world, at 165 out of the 170 countries in
the 2010 global

"Over 70 percent of Somalis are under the age of 30; most face blocked
transitions to adulthood due to multiple social, economic and
political exclusions. These are related to clan and cultural
affiliations, gender, age, illiteracy and poverty, among other
factors. They have been reinforced by dominant social attitudes and
prejudicial cultural practices, and perpetuated by violence. Exclusion
limits capabilities and opportunities, and constricts the
contributions of youth to peacebuilding and development. It also
dampens the natural energy and enthusiasm of youth, and systematically
hinders their potential for positive advancement."
[@undp-12-development, xix]

60 percent of them expressed an intent to flee the country and join
the large diaspora.  The frustration index is ??  which compares to
other countries.  The youth population expects the right to education
and healthcare, rights that have not been met in over 20 years.

The large refugee population and diaspora which fail to integrate into
the populace serve as fertile ground for terrorist recruiters


<!-- Conclusion -->

The restless men of of Somalia grow weary of your incompetence and
will not hesitate to turn to violence.  The social, economic dynamic
and infrastructure are chained together.  One cannot rise without the
others.  As Somalia picks its way to peace, it is presented with the
complex task of securing peace through three different channels and
consolidating on the gains hard-won by AMISOM.

Tie them together, social linked to infrastructure and economy.

As Mulderig notes, the problems causing the Arab Spring are not unique
to the Arab world.  "A youth bulge, massive youth unemployment,
increasing quantity but decreasing quality of education [...]
translates into a massive societal problem not seen to this extreme
elsewhere."[@mulderig-13-frustration, pg 26]
