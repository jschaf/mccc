The root cause of instability in Somalia is poor investment in human
development.  The United Nations defines human development is
equipping people with the "capabilities and opportunities they need to
make choices to improve their lives" and Somali is ranked at 165 of
170 countries in this regard. [@undp-12-development, *xviii*]  The
drivers of this instability are a neglected health and education
infrastructure, a weak economy and an excluded youth social group.
The derelict infrastucture reduces human captial and increases the
population's vunerability to recruiting efforts by extremist groups.
The Government's weak control of the formal economy drives instability
as rampant inflation decreases local purchasing power. The limited
opportunites offered through education and the economy frustrate
Somali youth and threaten to unravel recent improvements as youth
struggle to mature into adulthood.

<!-- Infrastructure -->

Somalia's health and education facilities are among the worst in the
world.  Infant mortality is 108 deaths per 1000 births and child
mortality is 178 deaths per 1000 children, ranking third highest in
the world. [@cia-14-somalia] The lack of external aid exacerbates the
problem.  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in North America as
Doctors Without Borders, departed Somalia in August 2013 after two
workers were finally released after being held hostage for almost two
years.  The release was the breaking point amidst dozens of previous
incidents.  Since MSF first arrived to Somalia in 1991, 14 staff
members were killed.  To protect their workers MSF hired armed guards,
providing Somalia the solemn distinction of being the only country in
which the MSF used armed guards. [@msf-13-closed] Assistance from MSF
is desperately needed to prop up existing infrastructure. In 2012,
"MSF teams provided more than 624,000 medical consultations, admitted
41,100 people to hospitals, helped deliver 7,300 babies, immunized
58,000 people, and treated 30,000 malnourished children."
[@msf-13-closed]  The lack of medical care reduces human capital
and increases population vunerability.

A study by the RAND corporation researched Al-Queda terrorist
recruitment techniques.  The research is applicable to Somalia because
al-Shabaab, the major terrorist group in Somalia, operates as an
affilate of al-Queda.  RAND found that al-Queda recruiters tailor
messages to match their audience and environment. Al-Queda targets
individuals with "a high level of current distress or dissatisfaction
(emotional, physical, or both)" [@daly-06-recruitment, 85] The
increased vunerability and distress caused by inadequate medical care
leaves many Somalis susceptible to terrorist recruiting campaigns,
decreasing internal security.

Education facilities collapsed in 1991 along with Siad Barre's Somali
Democratic Republic because central taxation and public funding
dissolved.  Somalia has been slow to recover.  Only 4.5 percent of
Somali children attend secondary school.  The reasons for the low
enrollment rate include the inability to pay private school fees (87.2
percent), marriage (49.5 percent), distance to the school (28.4
percent) and a familial requirement to work at home (27.5
percent). [@unesco-08-secondary] The lack of schooling harms economic
prospects.  A comprehensive report by the U.N. on 100 countries over
35 years "showed that economic growth is directly related to
achievements in secondary schooling."  [@undp-12-development, 6] The
inability to educate and harness human potential sows resentment among
youth.

The failings of Somali infrastructure deprive Somali youth of the
opportunity to grow and transition into adulthood.  Somali youth are
well aware of the universal right to education.  The U.N. Universal
Declaration of Human Rights states that "Everyone has the right to
education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and
fundamental stages." [@un-48-udhr, Article 26]  A 2012 U.N. survey
found that 82 percent of Somalis knew that they had a right to primary
education. [@undp-12-development, 53]  The U.N. human development
report examined levels of youth frustration using factors such as
"poor goverance and justice" and "no outlets to express aspiration and
need".  The overall frustration index score was 3.96 of 5, where 5 is
most frustrated.  The gap between the right to education and the
current Somali implementation frustrates youth and
blocks transition to adulthood.

<!-- Economic -->

The economy drives instability by excluding youth from business
opportunity and employment. The African Developmental Bank Group
(ADBG) is a financial institution that promotes economic and human
development in Africa, financing over $4 billion to improvement
projects in 2013 alone.[@adbg-14-about] A country brief by ADBG found
that many of Somalia's financial difficulties are related to its
nascent central banking system.  The Somali Central bank was
reestablished in 2009 with a $2 million grant from ADBG.  Though
Somalia established a number of historic firsts, including the first
national budget in two decades, poor public finance management hinders
human development.  The Somali Central Bank has not yet implemented
monetary policy.  Until the Central Bank takes charge of monetary
policy and implements a formal tax policy, inflation is expected to
remain near 300 percent, and profitable businesses will operate
untaxed.  The net result is a poor revenue base that leaves Somalia
reliant on external aid to improve their infrastructure and business
climate. [@adbg-13-somalia, 2, Annex 11 *xvi*]

One result of the lackluster business climate is a saturate job
market.  The highest level of youth frustration in the U.N. human
development report was lack of employment opportunities.  The
frustration is understable as overall unemployment stands at 54
percent and youth unemployment is a staggering 67 percent.
[@undp-12-development, *xx*] The high unemployment rate blocks youth
from reaching adult hold by excluding them from the labor market.  The
cost of youth economic exclusion is well studied.  Dr. Chaaban, an
economics professor at the American University of Beirut, showed that
the cost of youth exclusion reached 17 percent of GDP in Egypt ($53
billion) and 7 percent of GDP in Jordan ($1.5 billion).  The total
value of Egypt's agricultural sector is equivalent to the cost of
youth exclusion. [@chaaban-08-exclusion, 18]  Similar statistics are
unavaivable for Somalia because the last reliable socio-economic
survey was published in 2004.  Due to the dearth of statistics, ADBG
notes that "it is almost impossible to undertake planning and
programming work" or "monitor economic and social developments."
[@adbg-13-somalia, Annex 4 *iv*] As with education, the 2012
U.N. human development report survey show that the majority of Somali
youth (71 percent) recognize that they have right to decent work as
defined by the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. [@undp-12-development, 53]  The financial missteps of the
Somali government exclude Somali youth from fulfilling their
potential.

<!-- Social -->

Somalia's social dynamic drives instability because the large youth
population's frustration turns them towards radicalization.  The U.N.
Human Development Report described the crux of social issues in
Somalia:

> Lost opportunities, unclear identity and a growing sense of
> marginalization among youth in an environment of state collapse,
> violent conflict and economic decline provide fertile ground for
> youth radicalization.  The same reasons that have pushed young
> Somalis to join Al-Shabaab have also drawn them to join street
> gangs. [@undp-12-development, 2]

The overarching problem faced by Somali youth is the difficult
transition into adulthood.  As over 70 percent of Somalis are under
the age of 30, the problem is a serious one.  The transition into
adulthood is difficult because of "social, economic and political
exclusions" that are related to "cultural affiliations, gender, age,
illiteracy and poverty."  The exclusion diminishes the opportunites
available to youth and increases their
frustration. [@undp-12-development, *xix*]  The frustration opens
youth up to terrorist recruting messages.  Al-Queda specifically
targets "cultural disillusionment in a frustrated seeker (i.e.,
unfulfilled idealism)" as a factor in
recruitment. [@daly-06-recruitment, 85]

<!-- Conclusion -->

Mary Mulderig, a cultural anthropologist, noted that the problems
causing the Arab Spring are not unique to the Arab world.  "A youth
bulge, massive youth unemployment, increasing quantity but decreasing
quality of education [...]  translates into a massive societal problem
not seen to this extreme elsewhere."[@mulderig-13-frustration, pg 26]
Somalia, however, easily eclipses the problems of the Gulf states and
their Arab Spring.  Whereas the Gulf States struggled with a 10
percent unemployment rate, Somalia is debilitated with a 67 percent
unemployment rate.  Somalia stands at the precipice of disaster,
clutching stability anchored only by the recent, feeble gains in the
political and military environments.
