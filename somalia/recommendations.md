The six factors I analyzed were economy, physical environment,
politcal, infrastructure, social and the military.  The military,
political environment and physical environment were all assessed as
drivers of stability.  The excluded youth social group, infrastructre,
and economy were drivers of instability.  The primary driver of
instability in Somalia is the excluded youth population.  As such, the
United States should sponsor infrastructure projects to bolster health
and education development while parterning with AMISOM to maintain
security.  I contacted six Somalia ambassadors and ministers to ask
for their input on focus areas in Somalia.  They all declined to
respond.  As such, I will focus solely on the interests of the United
States which, incidentally, serve to further goals for Somalia
proposed the United Nations in their 2012 Human Development
Report. [@undp-12-development]

Regarding the other factors, the United States should not attempt to
further national interests through manipulation of the Somalia
economy, physical environment or poliitcal environment.  The economy
is currently fragile and any external influence might have unintended
consequences.  The United States should let the Somali economy grow
through the forces of the invisible hand as the infrastructure
improves.  The physical environment, especially the untapped natural
resources, should be left for future development by Somalia, lest we
be viewed as searching for oil.  Somalia has become one of the few
war-torn countries in recent memory to establish a democratic
republic.  Given that United States' track record in grooming
international leader is rather poor, i.e. Malachi, XXX, Somalia should
be left unimpeded to choose their own politicians.

The key to stabalizing Somalia lies in their youth.  Currently, youth
are disenfranchised due to a bleak job market with 67 percent
unemployment and a poor education experience that precludes them from
entering the job market.  Compounding the problem is the poor health
infrastructure which exposes the vulnerable populace to recruiting
efforts from Al-Shabaab.

Targeting youth directly is recommended for UN sanctioned aid groups
including ...   The United States should fund these groups.
Additionally, the U.S. should seek to aid Somali youth indirectly by
improving health and education infrastructure and by increasing the
security by partnering with AMISOM.  Before youth can ascend into self
actualization, they must meet the basic needs according to Maslow's
hierarchy of Needs.  The necessity of focusing on youth was explained
by Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

First, the United States should partner with AMISOM to continue to
degrade and destroy Al-Shabaab.  After the expansion of the AMISOM
mandate by the United Nations Security Council, AMISOM forces have
experienced unilateral success against Al-Shabaab.  On 5 October,
2014, AMISOM took the last stronghold of AMISOM in the town of
Barre. [@Afric2014SomaliaNational]  The best way to accomplish this is
too deploy the regionally aligned brigade assigned to AFRICOM, which
is 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division.

To support infrastructure needs, the U.S. will compete with China, who
already has a X dollars in investment.  The key focus should be the
education infrastructure and secondly, the health infrastructure.  The
United States should focus on providing security to non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) as a stop-gap measure until new infrastructure
may be completed.  Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known in the United
States as Doctors Without Borders departed Somalia in 2013 after
several kidnappings.  MSF provided badly needed healthcare.  The
benefits of improved healthcare systems in Somalia are made apparent
by the recent outbreak of Ebola.  In the current global environment,
epidemics pose a threat to all nations.  Thus, United States interests
are met with this goal.  The United States should continue to fund
infrastructure development.

The youth are the key to Somalia.   The United States supports its
national interests by ensuring peace in Somalia for the same reason
that apply to the Middle East.
