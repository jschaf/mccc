The raid on the prison camp Oflag XIII-B was audacious, fast and
doomed to failure.  The raid by Task Force Baum failed to liberate
prisoners from Oflag XII-B on 26-27 March 1945 because the mission
violated the characteristics of the offense, namely concentration and
tempo.  The principle of concentration was violated because political
influence force the mission to use a small task force of three
companies.  The principle of tempo was violated because an unfocused
mission did not narrow the scope of Baum's mission allowing Baum to
deviate to subobjectives, costing valuable time.

As LTG Patton liberated Bastogne, his 3rd Army contined the attack
north, crossing Rhine and entering the end game for WWII.  See Annex 1
for an overview of forces.  During this push, Patton was within 60
miles of Oflag XII-B, a German prison camp for offices.  Intelligence
from the Red Army indicated that a large group of prisoners was
recently transfered from \TODO{original prison camp?} to Oflag XIII-B.
Among the group of prisoners was rumored to be LTC John Waters,
Patton's son-in-law.  Patton wrote to his wife?, saying he was "close
to John" and had to give it a college try.

Among Patton's divisions, the 4th Armored Division was Patton's
favorite.  Patton gave the mission to Hoge, who protested at the
constraints imposed by Patton.  Patton, taking General of the Army
(GA) Bradley's guidance, insisted that no more than 300 men take part
in the operation.  Hoge assigned the mission to Combat Command B,
commanded by LTC Creighton Abrams.  A combat command was a precursor
to a combined arms brigade. Abrams assigned the mission to \TODO{LTC
name?}.  Unfortunately, LTC fuck face had a fierce case of hemoroids.
Upon close examination, Patton, who had seen many butts in his days in
the horse calvary, exclaimed "what the fuck joe."  CPT Abe Baum his S3
took the mission instead.  Baum received his orders at 1700 on 26
March, 1945 and prepared to move out at midnight.

The mission was unusual in all regards.  Patton had never before
liberated POW camps.  After the raid started, 3rd Army would continue
north, leaving TF Baum in 7th Army's AO.  Additionally, there was no
reserve and dedicated air support was limited to one propeller plane
to relay messages.  The 60 miles to Oflag XIII-B would take Task Force
Baum out of artillery range after 10 miles

Baum quickly assembled his task force, hand-picking Companies and
support elements.  He specifically request TSGT Graham.  Because some
other company was short on dudes he used Alpha and fuck-face
company???

Abrams used his \TODO{what companies used} companies to clear a route
through the town of Schweinhein for Task Force Baum.  The artillery
barrage began at 2030.  The men suffered greatly, naming the town
"bazooka city".  Impatient by the delay wrought by fierce German
resistance, at 2330, Baum told his men "we'll leave when I return
from the front."  After a brief scouting mission, Task Force Baum rolled
through Schweinheim, finally beginning their mission at 0030 on 27
March.

Berlin \TODO{German Army HQ name?} was notified of the breach thirty
minutes later at 0100 on 27 March.  Some nazi \TODO{Obstfelder?}
thought Patton had spotted the German weak point in their defense, so
they directed two divisions to reinforce the breach.

Baum reached his first objective at 0230, merging onto highway 26 near
the town of Laufach.  Along the route, Baum directed his Sherman tanks
to knock down the telephone poles to disrupt German communications.
Unsatisfied that the felled telephone were inoperable, Baum directed
his infantry to dismount and cut the wires to ensure the job was
done. They took their first casualty outside Lohr.  One Sherman was
disabled from a Panzerfoust.  The crew scrambled to other vehicles and
TF Baum continued.

Baum's 53 vehicle convoy streched over a mile and crawled along at 15
miles per hour due to black-out conditions.  They reached the town of
Lohr at \TODO{time at Lohr}, \TODO{Obstfelder Rank} Obstfelder,
commander of German's 19th Army stationed his headquarters at Lohr.
Baum continued to his objective, unaware of the prize before him.

\TODO{where pickup Lotz} German General, Lotz told everything

Baum planned to cross the Sinn River at Gemünden.  After enetering the
town they took heavy losses, losing 3TODO tanks to heavy fire.  Baum
returned to Langenprozelten to look for another crossing in the North.
As soon as the convoy started, the lead tank knocked a German Soldier
motorcyle rider off his bike.  After tactical questioning, Baum
discovered that the soldier was a Paratrooper that deserted from the
Eastern front to see his wife and newborn boy TODO: verify.  Baum took
the time to draw his knife and begin an elaborate sharpening routine
and genlty asked the Paratrooper the location of the next bridge.  The
Paratrooper quickly told the task force of a bridge at Burgsinn.  The
task force then moved out north.  The Paratrooper proved valuable,
coaxing several squads of Germans from hiding, exclaiming the
"American's are here".  Sotoloff, Baum's American translator helpfully
provided that it's better to surrender to Americans than Russians.

Task Force made quick progress towards Burgsinn, crossing the Sinn
River and continuing East to Graäfendorf, arriving just before 1300.
Upon cresting a hill, the task force stumbled upon 700 Russian POWs
guarded by 200 Germans.  Upon liberation, one Russian immediately gave
chase to one of the guards, tightly clenching a knife.  The Red Army
soldiers found a nearby liquor warehouse to celebrate their good
fortune.  Shortly after liberating the Russians, Baum notice a German
spotter plane near Weickersgruben.

Shortly afterwards, Baum spotted a German reconnaissance plane at
Weickersgruben

Koehl, a cool dude, recieved orders to move 20 miles and stop the
convoy.  Koehl had 8 *jagermiester*, tank destroyers with the fierce
88mm flak gun on a Tiger tank chassis.  Baum's speed prevented any
loss the first engagment.  Baum maneuvered his assault guns led by
Graham to destory the Koehl's *jagermeister's*.  Once, Baum's convoy
came into view they were crawling along, limited by TODO: what.  Baum
lost 1 Sherman, one light tank and 5 half-tracks.  Critically, the
half-tracks were carrying the extra fuel and ammunition the task force
need to return to American lines.

Baum took two hours disperse Koehl and the supporting infantry and
reached the entrance of Oflag XII-B.  After a spurious defense, the
Camp Commandant, GEN Fuck face, surrendered to his American POWs.  The
liberated Americans sent a small contingent to meet TF Baum.  Among
the group was LTC John Waters.  A German guard, unconvinced of the
camp surrender, promptly shot LTC Waters, missing his spine by
inches.  Task Force Baum continued into the camp, breaking down the
gates at 1630.  1500 Americans quickly surrounded the convoy, vastly
exceeding the 300 Baum was told to expect.

Baum broke the news that they didn't have room for all Americans.
Dejected, all but 60 POWs would remain at the camp until their
liberation 10 days later.  At 1830, Baum sent 1LT Nutto to find a
route to Highway 27.

By this time, Obstfelder understood the situation and moved to trap
Task Force Baum.  Using SS Anti-tank company and 100 Officer
Candidates under command GEN?? Hoepple.  Hoepple set up blocking
positions at Höllrich and Heßdorf.  After resupply Koehl's
*jagermeister's* moved to destroy TF Baum.

1LT Nutto moved slowly towards Bonnland.  Upon seeing a roadblock,
Nutto embarked north-west along a path to Heßdorf.  The eager OCS
cadets, set off a text book ambush, wounding 1LT Nutto and destroying
3 Shermans.

Baum moved to Höllrich and ran into the other road block, losing two
tanks in the process.  Completely blocked, Baum moved the task force
to Hill 427 for the night.

Unbeknownst to Baum, Hill 427 was a tank gunnery range for the
Hoepple's anti-tank course.  During the night, Hoepple's OCS cadets
moved within 50 meters of the American positions, supported by 5 Tiger
tanks.  Koehl maneuvered his *jagermeister's* into postion.  At 0810,
as Task Force Baum was preparing to depart, the ambush commenced.
With Koehl's 8? *Jagermeister's*, the 5 Tiger tanks and the 40-70
panzerfausts, the battle last only 25 minutes.  At 0835, Baum told the
group to escape and evade in groups of three or four and make for
American lines.  Only ?? made it back.


<!-- Analysis -->

Task Force Baum failed to liberate prisoners at Oflag XIII-B because
the task force violated two principles of the offense, concentration
and tempo.

Task Force Baum was not the appropriate formation for a daring raid 60
miles into enemy territory.  A raid is defined as "limited objectives,
large enought, blah blah".  When Patton assigned the mission, the
entire chain of command protested the small size.  Hoge, the division
commander, Abrams, the Combat Command, Piles dude and finally, Baum
questioned the rationale of using 300 troopers for a mission fraught
with risks.  Patton claims he was persuaded by Bradley to uphold the
small size, but the diaries of both generals conflict each other.

Maj Stiller

A raid is often a risky endeavour.  In the Hammelburg Raid, no attempt
was made to mitigae the multiple risks to mission accomplishment.  In
short the risks were; a small formation, no support from 3rd Army
since it was moving North, they were operating in 7th Army's area of
operations.

Patton never freed POW camps, clausewitz guidance.

No attempt was made to integrate Allied air power into the misison,
which by March 1944 was completely dominant.  Task Force Baum passed
out of artillery range after 10 miles, and so operated alone, unafraid
and unsupported past Laufach.

Secondly, the Task Force did not maintain the sufficient tempo need to
complete the raid while still operating within the safety net of
surprise and audacity.  Due to the politically directed nature of the
mission, things were not quite clear cut.  Patton alleged in a press
conference that "it really was all for deception."  As a consequence,
Baum took valuable time to destroy German infrastructure along the
route.  After using tanks to knock down telephone poles, Baum ordered
his infantry to move to cut the wires.  At Gemünden, Baum destroyed
several barges, and rail cars.

Additionally, U.S. Armor in WWII was unaccustomed to traveling at
night.  Under black-out conditions the Task Force managed only 15mph.

Initially, Patton's hallmarks of surpirse and audacity allowed the
Task Force relative safety.  However, after the release of Lotz at Graäfendorf,
Obstfelder knew the disposition and objective of Task Force Baum.
Shortly thereafter at 1400, the German scout plane reported the
composition, paiting a complete picture for Obstfelder.  It was at
this point that the battle was lost.  Baum lost any marked advantage
against the *Wehrmact* and was doomed to not complete the mission.

Audacity and suprise are often necessary for mission accomplishment
but were not sufficient for Task Force Baum.
