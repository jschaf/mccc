TF Baum failed to liberate prisoners from Oflag XII-B in the
Hammelburg raid because the mission violated the characteristics of
the offense, namely concentration and tempo.  The principle of
concentration was violated because...  The principle of tempo was
violated because an unfocused mission did not narrow the scope of
Baum's mission.

As Patton liberated Bastogne, his 3rd Army contined the attack north,
crossing Rhine and entering the end game for WWII.  See Annex 1 for an
overview of forces.  During this push, Patton was within 60 miles of
Oflag XII-B, a German prison camp for offices.  Intelligence from the
Red Army indicated that a large group of prisoners was recently
transferedd from TODO to Oflag XII-B.  Among the group of prisoners
was rumored to be John Waters, Patton's son-in-law.  Patton wrote to
his wife?, saying he was "close to John" and had to give it a college
try.

Among Patton's divisions, the 4th Armored Division ranked as Patton's
favorite.  Patton gave the mission to Hoge, who protested at the
constraints imposed by Patton.  Patton, taking GEN Bradley's guidance,
insisted that no more than 300 men take part in the operation.  Hoge
assigned the mission to LTC Creighton Abrams and his Combat Command B
which is equivalent to a combined arms brigade.  Abrams assigned the
mission to TODO?.  Unfortunately, LTC fuck face had a fierce case of
hemoroids.  Upon close examination, Patton, who had seen many butts in
his days in the horse calvary, exclaimed "what the fuck joe."  CPT Abe
Baum his S3 took the mission instead.  Baum received his orders at
1700 on 26 March, 1945 and prepared to move out at midnight.

Baum quickly assembled his task force, hand-picking Companies and
support elements.  He specifically request TSGT Graham.  Because some
other company was short on dudes he used Alpha and fuck-face
company???
