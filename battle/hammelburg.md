The Hammelburg raid was audacious, fast and a tactical failure.  Task
Force Baum failed to liberate prisoners from *Oflag XIII* on 27 March
1945 because the mission violated the characteristics of the offense,
namely concentration and tempo.  The characteristic of concentration
was violated because political influence directed the mission to use a
small task force that was unable to sustain operations in a deep raid.
The characteristic of tempo was violated because the the hastily
planned mission was bogged down by every unforeseen contingency.

\invisiblesection{Synopsis of the Hammelburg Raid}

After LTG Patton liberated Bastogne in December, 1944 his Third Army
continued the attack north, crossing the Rhine River and beginning the
end game of WWII.  See Figure \ref{fig:alliedOverview} for the
disposition of Allied and German Forces during the Hammelburg Raid.  During this
push, Patton found himself within 60 miles of *Oflag XIII*, a German
prison camp for offices.  Intelligence from the Red Army indicated
that a large group of prisoners was recently transferred from *Oflag
LXIV* in Szubin, Poland to *Oflag XIII* near Hammelburg,
Germany. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 173]  Among the group of prisoners
was rumored to be LTC John Waters, Patton's son-in-law.

Patton assigned the mission to Major General Manton Eddy, commander of
XII Corps, who passed it to the 4th Armored Division's commander,
Brigadier General William Hoge.  Among Patton's subordinates, the 4th
Armored was Patton's favorite.  Patton stated "There has never been
such a superb fighting organization as the Fourth Armored Division."
[@ForesBattleTrue, 298] Patton insisted that no more than 300 men take
part in the operation believing that the smaller force would be faster
than a larger formation.  Hoge assigned the mission to Combat Command
B, the precursor to a modern combined arms brigade, commanded by LTC
Creighton Abrams. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 14,19,20]  Patton said of
Abrams, "I am supposed to be the best tank commander in the Army, but
I have one peer -- Abe Abrams." [@Koyen1948GeneralPattons, 19]    Abrams
assigned the mission to LTC Cohen, commander of the 10th Armored
Infantry Battalion.  Unfortunately, LTC Cohen face had a fierce case
of hemorrhoids.  Upon personal examination, Patton, drawing on his
extensive experience as a cavalryman, exclaimed "That is some sorry
ass. Terrible." LTC Cohen suggest that his S3, CPT Abe Baum lead the
mission in his stead.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 20]  Baum received his
orders at 1700 on 26 March, 1945 and prepared to move out six hours
later. [@Jan1945Diary, 1]

The mission was unusual in many regards.  Patton had never before
liberated POW camps.  The precise location of the camp was unknown.
After the raid started, Third Army would continue North, leaving Task
Force Baum in Seventh Army's area of operations.  Additionally, there
was no reserve and dedicated air support was limited to one propeller
plane to relay radio messages.  The 60 miles to *Oflag XIII* would
take Task Force Baum out of artillery range after 10
miles. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 22,28]

Baum quickly assembled his task force, hand-picking Companies and
elements from the 37th Tank Battalion and the 10th Armored Infantry
Battalion.  From the 10th Armored Infantry Battalion, Baum selected
Alpha Company under command of CPT Lange and a reconnaissance section
under command of 2LT Hoeffner.  From the 37th Tank Battalion, Baum
received Charlie Company under command of 2LT Nutto, a platoon from
Delta Company under the command of 2LT Weaver and a platoon of tank
destroyers under command of TSGT Graham.  The final composition of
Task Force Baum was 11 officers, 283 men, and 53 vehicles.

Abrams used his two companies clear a route through the town of
Schweinheim for Task Force Baum.  The artillery barrage began at 2030.
Impatient by the delay wrought by fierce German resistance, at 2330,
Baum told his men "we'll leave when I return from the front."  After a
brief scouting mission, Task Force Baum charged through Schweinheim,
beginning their mission at 0030 on 27
March.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 54]

The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the German Supreme Command of
Armed Forces, was notified of the breach shortly thereafter at 0100.
The German staff surmised that Patton exploited a weak spot in the
German line. The OKW directed General Obstfelder, the Seventh Army
commander, to "concentrate all available forces to annihilate the
enemy task force."  [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 113] General Obstfelder
had assumed command that day after his predecessor, General Felber,
failed to defend the bridge at Remagen.  CPT Tobin Green, writing for
the Strategic Studies Research Seminar, noted the irony in the timing
of the replacement, as the "same event resulted in William Hoge's
promotion to brigadier general and command of the 4th Armored only
five days before the German Seventh Army change of command."
[@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 48]

Baum reached his first objective at 0230, merging onto Highway 26 near
the town of Laufach.  To hinder German reporting of his progress, Baum
directed his Sherman tanks to knock down the telephone poles to
disrupt German communications.  Unsatisfied that the felled telephone
were inoperable, Baum directed his infantry to dismount and cut the
wires to ensure the job was done. The technique was unsuccessful.
Driving under black-out conditions, the mile long convoy was limited
to 15mph.  News of the breach traveled faster than Baum's attack.  By
the time the convoy reached Fronhofen, white sheets greeted them,
hanging from windows in the early dawn.  The first road block appeared
a few miles later at Lohr.  While navigating around the overturned
truck, a *panzerfaust* destroyed the first vehicle from Task Force
Baum.  The crew of the tank scrambled from the vehicle as the rest of
convoy poured fire into the ambush
location. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 116-117]

Baum planned to cross the Sinn River at Gemünden, opting to take the
most direct route to Hammelburg.  Obstfelder, anticipating the route,
directed his troops to establish a hasty defense and to rig the bridge
with explosives.  As the column entered the town, they received
immediate, effective fire.  In the span of minutes, three tanks were
destroyed and several infantrymen succumbed to the heavy
fire. [@Baum1945NotesTask, 1]  Two Americans made it across the river
prompting the Germans to blow the bridge, sending two soldiers into
the river below.  With no way forward, Baum
began the precarious task of withdrawing an armored formation under
fire.  Baum returned to Langenprozelten and started North to find
another crossing .  Fortune returned to Baum as a wayward propaganda
team from Seventh Army bumped into the column as it moved North.  Baum
enlisted their help, and after a few broadcasts, 200 Germans from the
Gemünden defense promptly surrendered.  After the propaganda team left
back towards friendly lines, the convoy's lead tank knocked a German
rider off his motorcycles. [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 17]  After a
brief tactical questioning, Baum's interpreter, PFC Sotoloff discerned
that the soldier was a paratrooper and deserted from the Eastern front
to see his wife and newborn baby.  Baum took the time to draw his
knife before gently asking the paratrooper the location of the next
bridge.  The paratrooper quickly told of a bridge at Burgsinn
prompting Baum to continue north.  The paratrooper proved valuable,
coaxing several squads of Germans from hiding, exclaiming the
"American's are here".  Sotoloff helpfully added "It's better to
surrender to Americans than Russians."

Just before crossing the Sinn River, the task force captured
*Schutzstaffel* (SS) General Lotz.  Baum lashed Lotz to the hood of
half-track as a field expedient bullet shield and as Green helpfully
noted, a law of war violation.[@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 18] Lotz did
not ride with the column for long.  The convoy made rapid progress to
Gräfendorf, arriving just before 1300.  The task force stumbled upon
700 Russian POWs guarded by 200 Germans.  Baum liberated the Red Army
soldiers who quickly found a nearby liquor warehouse to celebrate
their good fortune.  Shortly afterwards, Baum noticed a German spotter
plane near Weickersgruben at 1400.  Determined fire forced the plane
away, but not before the pilot reported the composition and
disposition of the task force to Obstfelder.
[@Baum1945NotesTask page 2] After his release, Lotz quickly regained
control amidst the chaos of the Russian POWs and promptly told
Obstfelder of Baum's objective, which he had
overheard. [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, 193]

Obstfelder immediately notified the *Oflag XIII* commander, Major
General Goeckel and the Hammelburg area commander, COL Hoepple.
Unfortunately for Baum, a German *panzerjäger* (tank destroyer)
company commanded by *Hauptmann* (captain) Koehl, sat in ambush near
Hammelburg, having been alerted about an American break-through.
Koehl had 8 *panzerjäger's* equipped with an 88mm flak gun mounted on
a Tiger tank chassis. [@Robel2000PattonsHammelburg, 28-29]  With the
element of surprise, Koehl destroyed 1 Sherman, one light tank and 5
half-tracks.  Baum returned fire destroying three *panzerjäger's*
before Koehl withdrew.  Critically, the destroyed half-tracks were
carrying the extra fuel and ammunition the task force need to return
to American lines. Additionally, the fight took two hours,
time that Baum would need. [@Baum1945NotesTask, 2]

Baum took two hours disperse Koehl and the supporting infantry and
reached the entrance of *Oflag XIII*.  After a cursory defense, the
Camp Commandant, Generalmajor von Goeckel, surrendered to his American
POWs.  The liberated Americans sent a small contingent to meet Task
Force Baum.  Among the group was LTC John Waters.  A German guard,
unconvinced of the camp surrender, promptly shot LTC Waters, missing
his spine by inches.  Task Force Baum continued into the camp,
breaking down the gates at 1630.  1492 Americans quickly surrounded
the convoy, vastly exceeding the 300 Baum was told to
expect. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 390]  Baum broke the news that they
didn't have room for all Americans.  Dejected, only 200 prisoners
boarded the convoy.  At 1830, Baum sent 1LT Nutto to find a route to
Highway 27.

As Baum wrestled with the logistics of prisoner transportation,
Hoepple arranged his trap.  Hoepple commanded a training area for
replacement troops.  Under his command, Hoepple trained three classes,
a company of anti-tank NCOs, 300 SS officer cadets, and a platoon of
engineers.  Hoepple position the NCO anti-tank class south of
Bonnland.  The SS officer cadets established blocking positions at
Heßdorf and Höllrich, reinforced by the recent arrival of five tiger
tanks. [@Robel2000PattonsHammelburg, 30-31]  The engineer class joined
Koehl's *panzerjäger's* and moved south of Lager Hammelburg.  A German
assault gun battalion moved south of Hill 427 to setup an overwatch
position. [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 26]


Baum dispatched 1LT Nutto to find a route to Highway 27 at 1830, two
hours after arriving to the prison camp.  Blocked by a roadblock at
Bonnland, Nutto continued North-West towards Heßdorf.  The SS officer
cadets sprung their ambush, wounding Nutto and destroying 3 Sherman
tanks.  Nutto withdrew east and reported the ambush to Baum.  Just
before 2300, Baum moved the task force to linkup with Nutto's
reconnaissance element and continue searching for a route to American
lines. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 15]  Many prisoners were not as
optimistic and only 57 elected to remain with the
convoy. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 397]

From the prison camp, Baum moved east towards Höllrich and into
another ambush, losing two tanks.  Realizing that he was blocked, Baum
moved the task force to Hill 427 and waited for morning.  CPT Sheldon
Thompson, a liberated POW from *Oflag XIII* noted that the "action of
the last two nights and a day without rest was too much for
[Task Force Baum] and many, standing or sitting, slept even as the
column moved."  After arriving at Hill 427, Baum had just over 100
men, 3 light tanks, 4 Sherman tanks and 3 M4 Sherman assault guns and
15 half-tracks.  By this time, the vehicles were critically low on
fuel because the half-tracks carrying fuel were destroyed earlier by
Koehl's ambush.  While reorganizing, the task force siphoned gas from
8 half-tracks and then destroyed the half-tracks with thermite
grenades. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 18,19]

Unbeknownst to Baum, Hill 427 was a range for the Hoepple's anti-tank
course complete with fighting positions and a telephone network.
During the night, Hoepple's officer cadets moved within 50 meters of
the American positions waiting for the signal to begin their attack.
At 0810, as Task Force Baum was preparing to depart, the ambush
commenced with a volley from the assault gun
battalion. [@Inge2002HammelburgRaid, 7]  The coordinated attack
completely overwhelmed Baum's formation.  After 25 minutes, all
vehicles were destroyed.  At 0835, Baum told the group to escape and
evade in groups of three or four and make for American
lines. [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, 135]  Of the 293 men, 9 were
confirmed killed and 16 were reported missing.  Nearly all the of the
remainder spent time as POWs before the war ended.  Only 15
successfully escaped to American lines. [@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 26]

<!-- =====ANALYSIS===== -->
\invisiblesection{Analysis of the Hammelburg Raid}

The Hammelburg Raid failed to liberate prisoners at *Oflag XIII*
because the raid violated two of the four characteristics of the
offense, concentration and tempo.  The other characteristics of the
offense, surprise and audacity were present in abundance.

Task Force Baum was not an appropriate formation for a daring raid 60
miles into enemy territory because it lacked the combat power and
sustainment capabilities to operate through 60 miles of enemy terrain.
On the characteristic of concentration Patton wrote, "Never send a boy
on a man's job, the larger the force and the more violence you use in
the attack [...] the smaller will be your proportionate losses."
[@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 22] In doctrinal terms, "concentration is
massing of overwhelming effects of combat power to achieve a single
purpose." [@U.S.2012OffenseDefense, 3-1]  Patton eschewed his own
advice in ordering the raid.  When Patton assigned the mission, the
entire chain of command protested the small size.  Hoge, Abrams, Cohen
and Baum all questioned the rationale of using 300 men for a mission
fraught with risks.  Abrams strongly argued for using his whole combat
command, asserting that the almost 5,000 men of his "combat command
could go anywhere."  Despite the protests, Patton insisted on a small
force.  Patton claims he was persuaded by Bradley to use a small
formation, but the diaries of both generals conflict each
other. [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 671]

The risk of a small organic formation was not mitigated. Third Army
moved North the following day, leaving Task Force Baum in Seventh
Army's area of operations. Task Force Baum passed out of artillery
range after 10 miles, operating alone, unafraid and unsupported past
Laufach. Political power directed concentration in the wrong places.
Patton requested that MAJ Stiller, his aide-de-camp, accompany the raid.
Ostensibly, MAJ Stiller's purpose was to experience a "taste of
combat" but Stiller later told Baum that his purpose was to identify
LTC John Waters, Patton's son-in-law. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 23, 37]
Though Patton later vehemently denied organizing the raid to rescue
his son-in-law, his letters to his wife suggest he knew of Water's
location at *Oflag*. [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 664-665, 675]  The

Task Force Baum did not maintain the tempo needed to retain the
initiative and prevent the Germans from fixing their force.
Initially, Patton's hallmarks of surprise and audacity afforded the
Task Force relative safety under a blanket of fog.  Obstfelder slowly
lifted the fog of war as Baum continued.  At Weickersgruben,
Obstfelder had a complete and accurate picture of Baum's task force.
Obstfelder's scout plane confirmed the composition and disposition of
the column and Lotz confirmed the objective.  Without air support,
Baum had no means of preventing reconnaissance assets from observing
his position.  The compressed planning timeline orchestrated by Patton
prevented the synchronization of assets needed to maintain tempo
throughout the depth of the fight.  No attempt was made to integrate
Allied air power into the mission, which by March 1944 was completely
dominant.

Further eroding Baum's ability to control tempo was the poor
dissemination of information. Most of Baum's men were poorly informed
about the mission.  Consequently, at every unforeseen event, precious
time was lost as Baum worked to invent solutions.  For example, when
Baum was presented with almost 1,500 prisoners, it took almost two
hours for him to dispatch 1LT Nutto to begin the recon.  CPT Robert
Reppa, a liberated POW, noted that the "men were not informed and they
lost cohesion in the mass of liberated prisoners."
[@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 28-29] It another four and a half hours for the
convoy to finally depart *Oflag XIII*.  According another POW, CPT
Sheldon Thompson, the long time spent milling at the objective,
coupled with "hopeless aspect of the future [...] brought an inertia
and an apathy that would have been a serious problem even under more
favorable circumstances." [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 14] The lack of
contingency planning diminished Baum's tempo throughout the fight.

The lack of sleep compounded the friction resulting from the lack of
planning.  By the time Baum moved to Hill 427, his men had gone
without sleep for 100 hours. [@Whiti200348Hours, 28]  In assessing the
decisions of the leadership due to lack of sleep, Reppa wrote that
officers made "confused decisions and failed to make proper
reconnaissance."  [@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 29] Thompson reasserts this
view, stating that Baum "did not use the reconnaissance section as
frontal security at any time during the operation."
[@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 23] As a result, the convoy become
embroiled in short engagements that the reconnaissance section could
avoided. Baum failed to use his reconnaissance assets to prevent
friction from slowing his tempo.

Audacity and surprise are often necessary for mission accomplishment
but were not sufficient for Task Force Baum.  Task Force Baum holds
the distinction of venturing farther into enemy territory than any
force before without the promise of
reinforcement. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 111]  Patton acknowledged the
small force as his only mistake in the war writing in his journal,
"throughout the campaign in Europe I know of no error I made except
that of failing to send a combat command to
Hammelburg". [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 271]
