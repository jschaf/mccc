The Hammelburg raid was audacious, fast and a tactical failure.  Task
Force Baum failed to liberate prisoners from *Oflag XIII* on 27 March
1945 because the mission violated the characteristics of the offense,
namely concentration and tempo.  The characteristic of concentration
was violated because political influence directed the mission to use a
small task force that was unable to sustain operations in a deep raid.
The characteristic of tempo was violated because the the hastily
planned mission was disrupted by each unforeseen contingency.

\invisiblesection{Synopsis of the Hammelburg Raid}

After LTG Patton liberated Bastogne in December, 1944, his Third Army
continued the attack north, crossing the Rhine River and beginning the
end game of WWII.  See Figure \ref{fig:alliedOverview} for the
disposition of Allied and German Forces during the Hammelburg Raid.
During offensive, Patton found himself within 60 miles of *Oflag
XIII*, a German prison camp for officers.  Intelligence from the Red
Army indicated that a large group of prisoners was recently
transferred from *Oflag LXIV* in Szubin, Poland to *Oflag XIII* near
Hammelburg, Germany. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 173]  Among the group of
prisoners was rumored to be LTC John Waters, Patton's son-in-law.
Fearing the Germans might soon move the prisoners deeper into Germany,
he ordered a raid to liberate the POWs at
Hammelburg. [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 664-665]

Patton assigned the mission to Major General Manton Eddy, commander of
XII Corps, who passed it to the 4th Armored Division's commander,
Brigadier General William Hoge.  Among Patton's subordinates, the 4th
Armored was Patton's favorite.  Patton stated "There has never been
such a superb fighting organization as the Fourth Armored Division."
[@ForesBattleTrue, 298] Patton insisted that no more than 300 men take
part in the operation, believing that the smaller force would be
faster than a larger formation.  Hoge assigned the mission to Combat
Command B, the precursor to a modern combined arms brigade, commanded
by LTC Creighton Abrams. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 14,19,20]  Patton
said of Abrams, "I am supposed to be the best tank commander in the
Army, but I have one peer -- Abe Abrams."
[@Koyen1948GeneralPattons, 19] Abrams assigned the mission to LTC
Cohen, commander of the 10th Armored Infantry Battalion.
Unfortunately, LTC Cohen was incapacitated with a fierce case of
hemorrhoids.  Upon personal examination, Patton, drawing on his
extensive experience as a cavalryman, exclaimed "That is some sorry
ass. Terrible."  Cohen suggest that his S3, CPT Abe Baum lead the
mission in his stead.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 20] Baum received his
orders at 1700 on 26 March, 1945 and prepared to move out six hours
later. [@Jan1945Diary, 1]

The mission was unusual in many regards.  Patton had never before
liberated POW camps.  The precise location of the camp was unknown.
After the raid started, Third Army would continue North, leaving Task
Force Baum in Seventh Army's area of operations.  Additionally, there
was no reserve and dedicated air support was limited to one propeller
plane to relay radio messages.  The 60 miles to *Oflag XIII* would
take Task Force Baum out of artillery range after 10 miles.  Concerned
about the feasibility of the mission, Abrams said the mission "doesn't
have a chance" and that Baum's return would be
miraculous.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 22,28]

Baum quickly assembled his task force, hand-picking companies and
elements from the 37th Tank Battalion and the 10th Armored Infantry
Battalion.  From the 10th Armored Infantry Battalion, Baum selected
CPT Lange's Alpha Company and a 2LT Hoeffner's reconnaissance section.
From the 37th Tank Battalion, Baum received 2LT Nutto's Charlie
Company, 2LT Weaver's Platoon from Delta Company and TSGT Graham's
platoon of tank destroyers.  The final composition of Task Force Baum
consisted of 11 officers, 283 men, and 53 vehicles.

  the Beach to Bavaria}, 2\textsuperscript{nd} ed. (Munich, Germany:
  Herder Druck, 1946), 33;}

To pass Task Force Baum past German lines, Abrams used two companies
clear a route through the town of Schweinheim.  The artillery barrage
began at 2030 with three battalions of artillery firing ten volleys.
The attack began at 2100 and soon became mired amongst the staunch
German defense.  Impatient by the delay wrought by German resistance,
at 2330, Baum told his men "we'll leave when I return from the front."
After a brief scouting mission, Task Force Baum barreled through
Schweinheim, beginning their mission at 0030 on 27
March.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 54]

The *Oberkommando der Wehrmacht* (OKW), the German Supreme Command of
Armed Forces, was notified of the breach shortly thereafter at 0100.
The German staff surmised that Patton exploited a weak spot in the
German line. The OKW directed the newly promoted General Obstfelder,
the Seventh Army commander, to "concentrate all available forces to
annihilate the enemy task force."  [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 113]
General Obstfelder assumed command earlier that day after his
predecessor, General Felber, failed to defend the bridge at Remagen.
CPT Tobin Green, writing for the Strategic Studies Research Seminar,
noted the irony of the replacement, as Hoge's seizure of the same
bridge won him his "promotion to brigadier general and command of the
4th Armored only five days before the German Seventh Army change of
command."  [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 48]

Baum reached his first objective at 0230, merging onto Highway 26 near
the town of Laufach.  To hinder German reporting of his progress, Baum
directed his Sherman tanks to knock down the telephone poles to
disrupt German communications.  Unsatisfied that the felled telephone
poles were inoperable, Baum directed his infantry to dismount and cut
the wires to ensure the job was complete. The technique was
unsuccessful.  Driving under black-out conditions, the mile long
convoy was limited to 15mph.  News of the breach traveled faster than
Baum's attack and by the time the convoy reached Fronhofen, white
sheets greeted them, hanging from windows in the early dawn.  The
first road block appeared a few miles later at Lohr.  While navigating
around the overturned truck, a *panzerfaust* destroyed the first
vehicle from Task Force Baum.  The crew of the tank scrambled from the
burning hull as the rest of convoy poured fire into the ambush
location and continued east. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 116-117]

Baum planned to cross the Sinn River at Gemünden, opting to take the
most direct route to Hammelburg.  Obstfelder, anticipating the route,
directed his troops to establish a hasty defense and to rig the bridge
with explosives.  As the column entered the town, German defenders
welcomed them with immediate, effective fire.  In the span of minutes,
three tanks were destroyed and several infantrymen succumbed to the
heavy fire. [@Baum1945NotesTask, 1]  Two Americans made it across the
river prompting the Germans to blow the bridge, sending two soldiers
to their death in the river below.  With no way forward, Baum began
the precarious task of withdrawing an armored formation under fire.
Baum returned to Langenprozelten and started north to find another
crossing .  Fortune returned to Baum as a wayward propaganda team from
Seventh Army bumped into the column.  Baum enlisted their help, and
after a few broadcasts, 200 Germans from the Gemünden defense promptly
surrendered.  After the propaganda team departed towards friendly
lines, the convoy's lead tank knocked a German rider off his
motorcycles. [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 17]  After a brief tactical
questioning, Baum's interpreter, PFC Sotoloff discerned that the
soldier was a paratrooper and deserter from the Eastern front
returning to see his wife and newborn baby.  Baum took the time to
draw his knife before gently asking the paratrooper the location of
the next bridge.  The paratrooper quickly told of a bridge at Burgsinn
prompting Baum to continue north.  The paratrooper proved valuable,
coaxing several squads of Germans from hiding and into surrender,
exclaiming the "American's are here".  Sotoloff helpfully added "It's
better to surrender to Americans than Russians."

Just before crossing the Sinn River, the task force captured
*Schutzstaffel* (SS) General Oriel Lotz.  Baum lashed Lotz to the hood
of half-track as a field expedient bullet shield and as Green
helpfully noted, a law of war violation.[@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 18]
Lotz did not ride with the column for long, but long enough to
overhear the objective of the task force.  The convoy made rapid
progress to Gräfendorf, arriving just before 1300.  The task force
stumbled upon 700 Russian POWs guarded by 200 Germans.  Baum liberated
the Red Army soldiers who quickly found a nearby liquor warehouse to
celebrate their good fortune.  Baum deposited Lotz and the 200 Germans
with the Russians.  Continuing east, Baum noticed a German spotter
plane near Weickersgruben at 1400.  Determined fire forced the plane
away, but not before the pilot reported the composition and
disposition of the task force to
Obstfelder. [@Baum1945NotesTask page 2]  After his release, Lotz
quickly regained control amidst the chaos of the Russian POWs and
promptly told Obstfelder of Baum's
objective. [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, 193]

Obstfelder immediately notified the *Oflag XIII* commander, Major
General Goeckel and the Hammelburg area commander, COL Hoepple.
Unfortunately for Baum, a German *panzerjäger* (tank destroyer)
company commanded by *Hauptmann* (captain) Koehl, sat in ambush near
Hammelburg, alerted about Baum's break-through the hours after the
event.  Koehl had 8 *panzerjägers* equipped with an 88mm flak gun
mounted on a Tiger tank chassis. [@Robel2000PattonsHammelburg, 28-29]
With the element of surprise, Koehl destroyed 1 Sherman, one light
tank and 5 half-tracks.  Baum returned fire destroying three
*panzerjägers* before Koehl withdrew.  Critically, the destroyed
half-tracks were carrying the extra fuel and ammunition the task force
need to return to American lines. Additionally, the fight took two
hours, time that Baum would need. [@Baum1945NotesTask, 2]

By accident Baum veered south at Hammelburg, away from Koehl and into
Lager Hammelburg and *Oflag XIII*.  After a cursory defense, the Camp
Commandant, Generalmajor von Goeckel, surrendered to his American
POWs.  The liberated Americans sent a small contingent to meet Task
Force Baum.  Among the group was LTC John Waters.  A German guard,
unconvinced of the order to surrender, promptly shot Waters, missing
his spine by inches.  Waters was evacuated back to the prison camp
where he would remain until his liberation nine days later.  Task
Force Baum continued into the camp, breaking down the gates at 1630.
The American POWs quickly surrounded the convoy, totaling 1492 and
vastly exceeding the 300 Baum expected. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 390]
Baum broke the news that they didn't have room for all Americans.
Dejected, only 200 prisoners boarded the convoy.

As Baum wrestled with the logistics of prisoner transportation,
Hoepple arranged his trap.  Hoepple commanded a training area for
replacement troops.  Under his command, Hoepple trained three classes,
a company of anti-tank NCOs, 300 SS officer cadets, and a platoon of
engineers.  Hoepple positioned the NCO anti-tank class south of
Bonnland.  The SS officer cadets established blocking positions at
Heßdorf and Höllrich, reinforced by the recent arrival of five tiger
tanks. [@Robel2000PattonsHammelburg, 30-31]  The engineer class joined
Koehl's *panzerjäger's* and moved south of Lager Hammelburg.  A German
assault gun battalion moved south of Hill 427 to setup an overwatch
position. [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 26]


Baum dispatched 1LT Nutto to find a route to Highway 27 at 1830, two
hours after arriving to the prison camp.  Obstructed by a roadblock at
Bonnland, Nutto continued North-West towards Heßdorf.  The SS officer
cadets sprung their ambush, wounding Nutto and destroying 3 Sherman
tanks.  Nutto withdrew east and reported the ambush to Baum.  Just
before 2300, Baum moved the task force from *Oflag XIII* to linkup
with Nutto's reconnaissance element and continue searching for a route
to Highway 27. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 15]  After waiting for over
seven hours to depart, only 57 POWs elected to remain with the
convoy. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 397]

From the prison camp, Baum moved east towards Höllrich and into
another ambush, losing two tanks.  Realizing that he was blocked, Baum
moved the task force to Hill 427, hoping to break-through the
road-blocks in the morning.  CPT Sheldon Thompson, a liberated POW
from *Oflag XIII* noted that the "action of the last two nights and a
day without rest was too much for [Task Force Baum] and many, standing
or sitting, slept even as the column moved."  After arriving at Hill
427, Baum had just over 100 men, 3 light tanks, 4 Sherman tanks, 3 M4
Sherman assault guns and 15 half-tracks.  By this time, the vehicles
were critically low on fuel because the half-tracks carrying fuel were
destroyed earlier by Koehl's ambush.  While reorganizing, the task
force siphoned gas from eight half-tracks and then destroyed the
half-tracks with thermite grenades. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 18,19]

Unbeknownst to Baum, his assembly area at Hill 427 was the target area
of a range for the Hoepple's anti-tank course complete with fighting
positions and a telephone network.  During the night, Hoepple's
officer cadets moved within 50 meters of the American positions
waiting for the signal to begin their attack.  At 0810, as Task Force
Baum was preparing to depart, the ambush commenced with a volley from
the assault gun battalion. [@Inge2002HammelburgRaid, 7]  The
coordinated attack completely overwhelmed Baum's formation.  After 25
minutes, all vehicles were destroyed.  At 0835, Baum told the group to
escape and evade in groups of three or four and make for American
lines. [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, 135]  Of the 293 men, 9 were
confirmed killed and 16 were reported missing.  Nearly all the of the
remainder spent time as POWs before the war ended.  Only 15 men
successfully escaped to American lines. [@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 26]

<!-- =====ANALYSIS===== -->
\invisiblesection{Analysis of the Hammelburg Raid}

The Hammelburg Raid failed to liberate prisoners at *Oflag XIII*
because the raid violated two of the four characteristics of the
offense, concentration and tempo.  Surprise and audacity, the
remaining characteristics of the offense were present in abundance.

Task Force Baum was not an appropriate formation for a daring raid 60
miles into enemy territory because it lacked the combat power and
sustainment capabilities to operate through 60 miles of enemy terrain.
On the characteristic of concentration Patton wrote, "Never send a boy
on a man's job, the larger the force and the more violence you use in
the attack [...] the smaller will be your proportionate losses."
[@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 22] In doctrinal terms, "concentration is
massing of overwhelming effects of combat power to achieve a single
purpose." [@U.S.2012OffenseDefense, 3-1]  Patton eschewed his own
advice in constraining the raid force to 300 men.  When Patton
assigned the mission, the entire chain of command protested the small
size.  Hoge, Abrams, Cohen and Baum all questioned the rationale of
using 300 men for a mission fraught with risks.  Abrams strongly
argued for using his whole combat command, asserting that the almost
5,000 men of his "combat command could go anywhere."
[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 16] Despite the protests, Patton insisted on
a small force.  Patton claims he was persuaded by Bradley to use a
small formation, but the diaries of both generals conflict each
other. [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 671]  The consequence of the small
size was evident in the latter half of the mission.  In one
engagement, Baum lost all fuel and ammunition resupply.  Additionally,
after losing a few half-tracks, Baum did not have enough vehicles to
move even the 300 POWs he had planned to pick-up.

The risk of a small organic formation was not mitigated. Third Army
moved North the following day, leaving Task Force Baum in Seventh
Army's area of operations. Task Force Baum passed out of artillery
range after 10 miles, operating alone, unafraid and unsupported past
Laufach. Political power directed concentration in the wrong places.
Patton requested that MAJ Stiller, his aide-de-camp, accompany the raid.
Ostensibly, MAJ Stiller's purpose was to experience a "taste of
combat" but Stiller later told Baum that his purpose was to identify
LTC John Waters, Patton's son-in-law. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 23, 37]
Though Patton later vehemently denied organizing the raid to rescue
his son-in-law, his letters to his wife suggest he knew of Water's
location at *Oflag*. [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 664-665, 675]

Task Force Baum did not maintain the tempo needed to retain the
initiative and prevent the Germans from fixing their force.
Initially, Patton's hallmarks of surprise and audacity afforded the
Task Force relative safety under a blanket of fog.  Obstfelder slowly
lifted the fog of war as Baum continued toward his objective.  At
Weickersgruben, Obstfelder had a complete and accurate picture of
Baum's task force.  The German scout plane confirmed the composition
and disposition of the column and Lotz confirmed the objective.
Without air support, Baum had no means of preventing reconnaissance
assets from observing his position.  No attempt was made to integrate
Allied air power into the mission, which by March 1944 was completely
dominant.  The compressed planning timeline orchestrated by Patton
prevented the synchronization of assets needed to maintain tempo
throughout the depth of the fight.

Further eroding Baum's ability to control tempo was the poor
dissemination of information. Most of Baum's men were poorly informed
about the mission.  Consequently, at every unforeseen event, precious
time was lost as Baum worked to invent solutions.  For example, when
Baum was presented with almost 1,500 prisoners, it took almost two
hours for him to dispatch 1LT Nutto to begin the reconnaissance.  CPT
Robert Reppa, a liberated POW, noted that the "men were not informed
and they lost cohesion in the mass of liberated prisoners."
[@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 28-29] Baum did not depart the objective for
another four and a half hours.  According to another POW, CPT Sheldon
Thompson, the long time spent milling at the objective, coupled with
"hopeless aspect of the future [...] brought an inertia and an apathy
that would have been a serious problem even under more favorable
circumstances." [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 14] The lack of contingency
planning diminished Baum's tempo throughout the fight.

The lack of sleep compounded the friction resulting from the lack of
planning.  By the time Baum moved to Hill 427, his men had gone
without sleep for 100 hours. [@Whiti200348Hours, 28]  Citing his
firsthand experience, Reppa wrote that officers made "confused
decisions and failed to make proper reconnaissance."
[@Reppa1948ThatRaid, 29] Thompson reasserts this view, stating that
Baum "did not use the reconnaissance section as frontal security at
any time during the operation."  [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 23] As a
result, the convoy become embroiled in short engagements that the
reconnaissance section could avoided. Baum failed to use his
reconnaissance assets to prevent friction from slowing his tempo.

Audacity and surprise are often necessary for mission accomplishment
but they were not sufficient for Task Force Baum.  Task Force Baum
holds the distinction of venturing farther into enemy territory than
any force before without the promise of
reinforcement. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 111]  Patton acknowledged the
use of a small force as his only mistake in the war writing in his
journal, "throughout the campaign in Europe I know of no error I made
except that of failing to send a combat command to
Hammelburg". [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 271]  Though audacity and
surprise often determine success, Task Force Baum required detailed
planning and support to build the concentration and tempo required to
liberate the prisoners at *Oflag XIII*.
