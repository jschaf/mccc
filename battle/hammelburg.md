The raid on the prison camp *Oflag XIII* was audacious, fast and
doomed to failure.  The raid by Task Force Baum failed to liberate
prisoners from *Oflag XIII* on 26-27 March 1945 because the mission
violated the characteristics of the offense, namely concentration and
tempo.  The principle of concentration was violated because political
influence directed the mission to use a small task force of three
companies that was unable to sustain operations in a deep raid.  The
principle of tempo was violated because the the hastily planned
mission was bogged down by every unforeseen contingency.

\invisiblesection{Synopsis of the Hammelburg Raid}

As LTG Patton liberated Bastogne, his 3rd Army continued the attack
north, crossing Rhine and entering the end game for WWII.  See Annex 1
for an overview of forces.  During this push, Patton found himself
within 60 miles of *Oflag XIII*, a German prison camp for offices.
Intelligence from the Red Army indicated that a large group of
prisoners was recently transferred from *Oflag LXIV* in Szubin, Poland
to *Oflag XIII* near Hammelburg, Germany. [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 173]
Among the group of prisoners was rumored to be LTC John Waters,
Patton's son-in-law.

Patton gave the mission to Major General Manton Eddy, commander of XII
Corps, who passed it to the 4th Armored Division's commander,
Brigadier General William Hoge.  Among Patton's subordinates, the 4th
Armored was Patton's favorite.  Patton stated "There has never been
such a superb fighting organization as the Fourth Armored Division."
[@ForesBattleTrue, 298] Patton insisted that no more than 300 men take
part in the operation believing that the smaller force would be faster
than a larger formation.  Hoge assigned the mission to Combat Command
B, commanded by LTC Creighton
Abrams. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 14,19,20]  Patton said of Abrams, "I
am supposed to be the best tank commander in the Army, but I have one
peer -- Abe Abrams." [@Koyen1948GeneralPattons, 19] A combat command was
a precursor to a combined arms brigade. Abrams assigned the mission to
LTC Cohen, commander of the 10th Armored Infantry Battalion.
Unfortunately, LTC Cohen face had a fierce case of hemorrhoids.  Upon
personal examination, Patton, drawing on his extensive experience as a
cavalryman, exclaimed "That is some sorry ass. Terrible." LTC Cohen
suggest that his S3, CPT Abe Baum lead the mission in his
stead.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 20]  Baum received his orders at 1700
on 26 March, 1945 and prepared to move out six hours
later. [@Jan1945Diary, 1]

The mission was unusual in many regards.  Patton had never before
liberated POW camps.  The precise location of the camp was unknown.
After the raid started, Third Army would continue north, leaving Task Force Baum
in Seventh Army's area of operations.  Additionally, there was no reserve
and dedicated air support was limited to one propeller plane to relay
radio messages.  The 60 miles to *Oflag XIII* would take Task Force
Baum out of artillery range after 10
miles. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 22,28]

Baum quickly assembled his task force, hand-picking Companies and
support elements from the 37th Tank Battalion and the 10th Armored
Infantry Battalion of Combat Command B.  The final composition of Task
Force Baum was 11 officers, 283 men, and 53 vehicles.  From the 10th
Armored Infantry Battalion, Baum had Alpha Company under command of CPT Lange and a
reconnaissance section under command of 2LT Hoeffner.  From the 37th
Tank Battalion, Baum received Charlie Company under command of 2LT
Nutto, a platoon from Delta Company under the command of 2LT Weaver
and a platoon of tank destroyers under command of TSGT Graham.

Abrams used his \TODO{what companies used} companies to clear a route
through the town of Schweinheim for Task Force Baum.  The artillery
barrage began at 2030.  The men suffered greatly, naming the town
"bazooka city".  Impatient by the delay wrought by fierce German
resistance, at 2330, Baum told his men "we'll leave when I return
from the front."  After a brief scouting mission, Task Force Baum rolled
through Schweinheim, finally beginning their mission at 0000 on 27
March.[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 54]

The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), German High Command, was
notified of the breach shortly thereafter at 0100.  The German staff
surmised that Patton exploited a weak spot in the German line and
directed General Obstfelder, the Seventh Army commander, to
"concentrate all available forces to annihilate the enemy task force."
[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 113] General Obstfelder had assumed command
that day.  His predecessor, General Felber failed to defend the bridge
at Remagen.  CPT Tobin Green, writing for the Strategic Studies
Research Seminar, noted that "Ironically, this same event resulted in
William Hoge's promotion to brigadier general and command of the 4th
Armored only five days before the German Seventh Army change of
command." [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 48]

Baum reached his first objective at 0230, merging onto Highway 26 near
the town of Laufach.  To hinder German reporting of his progress, Baum
directed his Sherman tanks to knock down the telephone poles to
disrupt German communications.  Unsatisfied that the felled telephone
were inoperable, Baum directed his infantry to dismount and cut the
wires to ensure the job was done. The technique was unsuccessful.
Under black-out driving conditions, the mile long convoy was limited
to 15mph.  News of the breach traveled faster than Baum's attack.  By
the time the convoy reached Fronhofen, they were greeted by white
sheets hanging from windows in the early dawn.  The first road block
materialized a few miles later at Lohr.  While navigating around the
overturned truck, a *panzerfaust* destroyed the first vehicle from
Task Force Baum.  The crew of the tank scrambled from the vehicle as
the rest of convoy poured fire into the ambush
location. [@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 116-117]

Baum planned to cross the Sinn River at Gemünden, opting to take the
most direct route to Hammelburg.  Obstfelder, anticipating the route,
directed his troops to establish a hasty defense and to rig the bridge
with explosives.  Upon entering the town they Baum received immediate,
effective fire.  In the span of minutes, three tanks were destroyed
and several infantrymen succumbed to the heavy
fire. [@Baum1945NotesTask, 1]  Two men made it across the bridge
prompting the Germans to blow the bridge.  With no way forward, Baum
began the precarious task of withdrawling an amored formation under
fire.  Baum returned to Langenprozelten and started North to find
another crossing .  Fortune returned to Baum as a wayward propaganda
team from Seventh Army bumped into the column as it moved North.  Baum
enlisted their help, and after a few broadcasts, 200 Germans from the
Gemünden defense promptly surrendered.  After the propaganda team left
back towards friendly lines, the convoy's lead tank knocked a German
rider off his motorcycles. [@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 17]  After a
brief tactical questioning, Baum's interpreter, PFC Sotoloff
discerened that the soldier was a paratrooper and deserted from the
Eastern front to see his wife and newborn baby.  Baum took the time to
draw his knife before gently asking the paratrooper the location of
the next bridge.  The paratrooper quickly told of a bridge at Burgsinn
prompting Baum to contine north.  The paratrooper proved valuable,
coaxing several squads of Germans from hiding, exclaiming the
"American's are here".  Sotoloff helpfully added "It's better to
surrender to Americans than Russians."
[@BaronBG2009RaidUntold, 134-137]

Just before crossing the Sinn River, the task force captured
*Schutzstaffel* (SS) General Lotz.  Baum lashed Lotz to the hood of
half-track as a field expedient bullet shield and as Green helpfully
noted, a law of war violation.[@Green1994HammelburgRaid, 18] Lotz did
not ride with the column for long.  The convoy made rapid progress to
Gräfendorf, arriving just before 1300.  The task force stumbled upon
700 Russian POWs guarded by 200 Germans.  The Red Army soldiers found
a nearby liquor warehouse to celebrate their good fortune.  Shortly
after liberating the Russians, Baum noticed a German spotter plane
near Weickersgruben at 1400. [@Baum1945NotesTask page 2]  Get Lotz at
Burgsinn release at Gräfendorf. [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, 193]

Koehl, a cool dude, received orders to move 20 miles and stop the
convoy.  Koehl had 8 *Jagdpanthers*, tank destroyers with the fierce
88mm flak gun on a Tiger tank chassis.  Baum's speed prevented any
loss the first engagement.  Baum maneuvered his assault guns led by
Graham to destroy the Koehl's *jagermeister's*.  Once, Baum's convoy
came into view they were crawling along, limited by \TODO{what
limitation for Koehl ambush} Baum lost 1 Sherman, one light tank and 5
half-tracks.  Critically, the half-tracks were carrying the extra fuel
and ammunition the task force need to return to American
lines. [@Baum1945NotesTask page 2]

Baum took two hours disperse Koehl and the supporting infantry and
reached the entrance of *Oflag XIII*.  After a spurious defense, the
Camp Commandant, Generalmajor von Goeckel, surrendered to his American POWs.  The
liberated Americans sent a small contingent to meet Task Force Baum.  Among
the group was LTC John Waters.  A German guard, unconvinced of the
camp surrender, promptly shot LTC Waters, missing his spine by inches.
Task Force Baum continued into the camp, breaking down the gates
at 1630.  1492 Americans quickly surrounded the convoy, vastly
exceeding the 300 Baum was told to
expect.[@Baum1945NotesTask page 1], [@MelteRoadsLiberation, 390]

Baum broke the news that they didn't have room for all Americans.
Dejected, all but 60 POWs would remain at the camp until their
liberation 10 days later.  At 1830, Baum sent 1LT Nutto to find a
route to Highway 27.

Ran out of fuel [@Baum1945NotesTask, 3]

By this time, Obstfelder understood the situation and moved to trap
Task Force Baum.  Using SS Anti-tank company and 100 Officer
Candidates under command GEN?? Hoepple.  Hoepple set up blocking
positions at Höllrich and Heßdorf with an SS cadet company, composed
of veterans.  Hoepple moved the NCO tank company south of Bonnland to
setup an ambush for Task Force Baum.  After
resupply Koehl's *jagermeister's* moved to destroy Task Force Baum.

1LT Nutto moved slowly towards Bonnland.  Upon seeing a roadblock,
Nutto embarked north-west along a path to Heßdorf.  The eager OCS
cadets, set off a text book ambush, wounding 1LT Nutto and destroying
3 Sherman tanks.  Nutto moved back to the main road and sent the report to
CPT Baum.  Just before 2300, Baum moved the task force to linkup with Nutto's
reconnaissance element. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 15]

Baum moved back to Höllrich and ran into the other road block, losing
two tanks in the process.  Completely blocked, Baum moved the task
force to Hill 427 for the night.  CPT Sheldon Thompson, a liberated
POW from *Oflag XIII* noted that the "action of the last two nights
and a day without rest was too much for [Task Force Baum] and many,
standing or sitting, slept even as the column moved."  Upon arriving
to Hill 427, Baum had just over 100 men, 3 light tanks, 4 Sherman
tanks and 3 M4 Sherman assault guns and 15 half-tracks.  While
reorganizing, Baum ordered the gas siphoned from 8 half-tracks and
then a thermite grenade placed in the fuel
tank. [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 18,19]

Unbeknownst to Baum, Hill 427 was a tank gunnery range for the
Hoepple's anti-tank course.  During the night, Hoepple's OCS cadets
moved within 50 meters of the American positions, supported by 5 Tiger
tanks.  Koehl maneuvered his *jagermeister's* into position.  At 0810,
as Task Force Baum was preparing to depart, the ambush
commenced. [@Inge2002HammelburgRaid, 7]  With Koehl's 8?
*Jagermeister's*, the 5 Tiger tanks and the 40-70 panzerfausts, the
battle last only 25 minutes.  At 0835, Baum told the group to escape
and evade in groups of three or four and make for American lines.
Only ?? made it back.


\invisiblesection{Analysis of the Hammelburg Raid}

Task Force Baum failed to liberate prisoners at *Oflag XIII* because
the task force violated two principles of the offense, concentration
and tempo.

Task Force Baum was not the appropriate formation for a daring raid 60
miles into enemy territory.  A raid is defined as "limited objectives,
large enough, blah blah".  When Patton assigned the mission, the
entire chain of command protested the small size.  Hoge, the division
commander, Abrams, the Combat Command, Piles dude and finally, Baum
questioned the rationale of using 300 troopers for a mission fraught
with risks.  Patton claims he was persuaded by Bradley to uphold the
small size, but the diaries of both generals conflict each other.

Maj Stiller

A raid is often a risky endeavor.  In the Hammelburg Raid, no attempt
was made to mitigate the multiple risks to mission accomplishment.  In
short the risks were; a small formation, no support from 3rd Army
since it was moving North, they were operating in 7th Army's area of
operations.

Patton never freed POW camps, Clausewitz guidance.

No sleep 100 hours at 0230[@Whiti200348Hours, 28]

misleading motives
Beatrice may get there [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 664]
Hope to send expedition [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 665]
directed eddy, reluctant fear of criticism [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 665]
Press conference [@Blume1996PattonPapers, 675]

"However, as General Patton himself remarked, 'Never send a boy on a
man's job, the larger the force and the more violence you use in the
attack [...] the smaller will be your proportionate
losses.'" [@Thomp1948OperationsTask, 22]
No attempt was made to integrate Allied air power into the mission,
which by March 1944 was completely dominant.  Task Force Baum passed
out of artillery range after 10 miles, and so operated alone, unafraid
and unsupported past Laufach.

CPT Sheldon's lessons:
1. A unit should not be given an exploitation mission beyond its
inherent capabilities.
2. Lack of sleep and rest lowers combat efficiency and staying power.
3. Speed and violence of attack saves time and lives during
   exploitation.
4. Proper use of light reconnaissance will conserve the strength of a
unit as well as give it security.
11. Reorganization, to be successful, must be conducted with all
possible speed.
16. Courage and leadership alone cannot insure (sp) the success of an
    operation.
[@Thomp1948OperationsTask, page 26,27]

Secondly, the Task Force did not maintain the sufficient tempo need to
complete the raid while still operating within the safety net of
surprise and audacity.  Due to the politically directed nature of the
mission, things were not quite clear cut.  Patton alleged in a press
conference that "it really was all for deception."  As a consequence,
Baum took valuable time to destroy German infrastructure along the
route.  After using tanks to knock down telephone poles, Baum ordered
his infantry to move to cut the wires.  At Gemünden, Baum destroyed
several barges, and rail cars.

Additionally, U.S. Armor in WWII was unaccustomed to traveling at
night.  Under black-out conditions the Task Force managed only 15mph.

Initially, Patton's hallmarks of surprise and audacity allowed the
Task Force relative safety.  However, after the release of Lotz at
Gräfendorf, Obstfelder knew the disposition and objective of Task
Force Baum.  Shortly thereafter at 1400, the German scout plane
reported the composition, painting a complete picture for
Obstfelder.   It was at this point that the battle
was lost.  Baum lost any marked advantage against the *Wehrmacht* and
was doomed to not complete the mission.

"Most confused state" [@Koyen1946FourthArmored, page 205]

Audacity and surprise are often necessary for mission accomplishment
but were not sufficient for Task Force Baum.
