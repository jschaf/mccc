 Joe Schafer's Personal Battle Experience
==========================================

It was a dark and stormy night.  All across the land nervous
paratroopers filed onto Bagram Air Field.  Bagram Air Field, known
commonly as BAF was a hustle of activity all through the night.  We
moved out to Camp Montrond, the headquarters of Speical Operations
Task Force - East, (SOTF-E).  SOTF-E was regionally aligned with
RC-East and was where we were to conduct combat operations for the
next nine months.

I was the platoon leader of Anti-tank Platoon 4 (AT4).  Most of our
battalion was dispersed by squads and sections to the Special Forces
teams, Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) across the whole of
Afghanistan.  Delta company, my company, was instead broken down by
Platoon and tasked to act as the forward logistics element.  We would
bring supplies to ODAs in our region.

We inprocessed for a couple of weeks at BAF, and did our left
seat/right seat rides with the existing FLE at Camp Montrond.  We
eventually moved down to Gardez and took over a small portion of FOB
Lightning and appropriatley named it Camp Destroyer.  Our call sign
was strong arm, chosen because the sum of the commander's and the
first sergeant's bicep was ?45in.

A week later, in July 2011, we conducted our first solo mission.  We
were conducting a route reconnaissance.  We were following an 11 truck
route clearance patrol up to COP Herrera.  Afghan roads are like the
highlander, there can be only one.  There was exactly one way to get
to each COP or VSP we would travel to.  RCP placed named areas of
interest on portions of the road with more risk of an IED.  While
traveling through an NAI.  The RCP would send two soldiers ahead of
the convoy to check culverts for IEDs.  The rationale was, that the
Taliban would not "waste" an IED on only a soldier.  Once we passed
through an NAI, everyone would mount up and we would travel at our
normal convoy speed.

Unfortunately, this is when I learned the mantra, just because RCP
traveled the route, it doesn't mean it is clear.  About two hundred
meters outside the NAI, the Taliban detonated a command wire IED on
the last truck in the convoy.  Because we were trailing RCP, it was my
PSGs truck.  The blast blew the truck up and off the road, into a
shallow creek.  No one was injured apart from some minor concussions.
This is when I really learned to listen to my platoon sergeant.  While
we conducted our relief in place with orignal FLE at Camp Montrond,
the SF soldiers would have a trunk monkey stand during the entire
ride.  My PSG thought this was insane in an area known more for large
IEDs than for direct fire ambushes, so he told all his paratroopers to
sit down.  This foresight undoubtedly saved CPL Copeland's life.

We experimented with different TTPs for several convoys to reduce the
chance of getting blown up.  In my experience, RCP was largely
ineffective for finding IEDs.  The taliban favored command-wire IEDs due
to the overwhelming precense of jammers we carried.  Fortunately, they
were lazy and didn't like night shifts.  We transitioned to operating
solely at night.  We didn't get blown up once at night.

In addition to the IEDs, the Taliban would often conduct ambushes on
our convoy.  The ambushes were always ineffective and never paired
with an IED for a complex ambush.  We would often take AK-47 fire at
our RG-33 which didn't do anything.  The only real danger was an RPG
which were rarely used.

Our choice of weapon system influenced how often we were attacked.
The enemy was familiar with the capabilities of our various weapons
systems.  We used MK-19s, M2 .50cals as the primary weapons systems on
all trucks.  The Taliban feared the MK-19 and we would not get
attacked at all if we were rocking the MK-19.  My theory is that the
enemy feared weapons with a burst radius as it's much more difficult
to find cover from an explosion.
